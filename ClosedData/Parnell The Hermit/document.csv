"Myr shoh t’ou er dty ynsagh, gow ayns shee, ","“Thus Heaven instructs thy mind: this trial o’er,"
as ny jean peccah reesht er oyr erbee.” ,"depart in peace, resign, and sin no more.”"
Skianyn yn ainle chelleeragh eisht ren feiyr ,"On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew,"
myr ren e getlagh seose ’syn aer lesh siyr; ,the sage stood wondering as the seraph flew.
"yn hermit gyindys myr va, keayrt dy row, ","thus looked Elisha, when, to mount on high"
"Elisha tra hie ’vainshtyr seose gys niau, ",his master took the chariot of the sky;
ayns fainagh aileagh goll er e yurnaa; ,the fiery pomp ascending left the view;
"v’eh ’r gholl er ’eiyrt, beagh rheamys currit da.","the prophet gazed, and wished to follow too."
"Eisht ghlioon yn hermit, gra, “D’row aigney Yee ","The bending hermit here a prayer begun,"
"jeant liorish deiney, myr ny flaunyssee.” ","“Lord! as in Heaven, on Earth thy will be done!”"
"Eisht gys e chummal hie eh, raad va ’oayll, ","Then gladly turning, sought his antient place,"
as leeid eh bea dy chraueeaght sheeoil. ,and passed a life of piety and peace.
