Ny c’raad dy follit oddin soie?,Or whither from thy Presence run?
"Dy voddin getlagh seose gys niau,","8 If up to Heav’n I take my Flight,"
Coamrit ayns soilshey yn raad t’ou;,"’Tis there thou dwell’st enthron’d in Light,"
"Dy voddin chea gys niurin heese,","Or sink to Hell’s infernal Plains,"
Shen raad t’ou ooilley-niartal neesht.,’Tis there Almighty Vengeance reigns.
"Dy voddin skianyn ’voghrey ’ghoaill,","9 If I the Morning’s Wings could gain,"
As getlagh foddey veih my oayll;,"And fly beyond the Western Main,"
"Ayns shen nee oo m’y gheddyn magh,","10 Thy swifter Hand would first arrive,"
As m’y ghoaill seose myr dagh chimmagh.,And there arrest thy Fugitive.
