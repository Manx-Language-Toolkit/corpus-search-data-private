How many young persons, apprentices and servants, [iv] are there, (as well as children) who know but very little of the Saviour that redeemed them, and seem not so much as to have heard whether there be any Holy Ghost? Nay, how many grown people arc there, people in years too, who have lived all their days without knowing these first Principles of Religion! Perhaps it will hardly be believed, that there is so much ignorance in a Christian nation, where the Gospel is daily preached, and the light of it has shined so long. But if a strict and particular enquiry was made, I fear the Truth of what I say would appear in too many sad instances.",

It is our duty to warn Parents and Masters of Families of their carelessness and negligence of the souls under their charge, and to admonish them to take a more diligent care for the future, to teach their children and servants the knowledge of God and their duty.",

In all arts and sciences some considerable time and pains are spent in learning the terms, or first principles of them; and ought not the same and greater care to be taken in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God? ought not our children to be well instructed in the meaning of the terms and words that are generally used in the Christian Doctrine, before they can make any proficiency in the knowledge or practice of it?",
"—Cha moo ta lheid yn Ynsagh shoh ymmyrchagh da Cloan ny lomarcan, agh da ooilley ta trooid merioose [i.e. meerioose] nyn Ayraghyn, Moiraghyn as Oseiryn, as yn Assee jeh laccal Ynsagh, meehushtagh jeh ny ta ymmyrchagh daue dy chredjal as dy hoiggal cour saualtys.","Neither are instructions of this sort designed only for children, but for all, who, [vii] through the carelessness of their Parents and Governors, and the misfortune of a low education, are ignorant of what is necessary for them to believe and know, in order to their Salvation.",

Use all possible endeavours to teach them to read, and to instruct them in the first principles of our most Holy Religion:",

I have endeavoured, in as short a compass, and as clearly as I could, to explain the Two Covenants, a subject of great consequence, in which every Christian ought to be well instructed, in order to know the wonderful scheme of our Redemption, the conditi[xxxv]ons of our Salvation, and the nature of the Sacraments: I wish this necessary point was better understood than it usually is. ",

"Er son troshtaghyn yn Aglish, ta chiart cha beg dy gheill ec lheid y sleih jeu, dy jarroo jeh’n ard trostey jeu ooilley, Jea-heiney Cheast.","And as to the Fasts of the Church, they are as little known to such People, even that solemn Fast of all, Good Friday.",

If then Parents and Masters of Families would take that care, which in conscience they are bound, to sow the seeds of religion in due season, in the minds of their children and servants; if on these holy days they would constantly call their families together to instruct them in the meaning of such days, to enquire of them what was taught from the Pulpit, &c. we should soon see a vast alteration for the better: that shameful ignorance which is now so justly to be complained of, would be chased away, and we might hope to see Religion take root and flourish amongst us.",
"As dy jinnah [sic: jinnagh] dy chooilley phersoon ta gyn Ynsaghey, dagh Blein ec cheet ny fealiaghyn as laghyn trosht jannoo ny oddys ad dy ynsagh ny ta ’sy lioar shoh kiaryt er nyn son, cha jinnagh ad ny lomarcan cheet gys toiggal share jeh ny laaghyn shoh, agh gys tushtey myrgeddyn jeh folliaghtyn nyn Gredjue Casherick, ta er skyn ooilley ymmyrchagh da dagh Creestee dy hoiggal.","And if all unlearned persons would every year, at the return of the great Feasts and Fasts, endeavour to learn what is here provided for them, they [xxxviii] would not only become better acquainted with these days, but would be let into the knowledge of the mysteries of our most holy Religion, absolutely necessary for every Christian to understand.",
"[xxx] As myr ta ayns dagh Cabdil Bun er ny choyrt er lheid ny focklyn, as nagh vel liorish laane sleih er ny doiggal, myrgeddin ta meanal er ny chur er laane Raaghyn elley jeant ymmyd jeu ayns ny Scriptyryn casherick as ayns shermaanyn son nagh beagh sleih erbee ec coayl son toiggal lheid ny Goan.","And as I have all along explained under every chapter such words as I thought were not generally known, so I have added in the end, the meaning of several other terms used in the holy Scriptures, and in sermons, that. common people might not be at a loss when they meet with these expressions; ",

"Shen y fa ta jercal dy ve jeant, dy vod eh y ve jeh ymmyd as Vondeish mooar daue dy vel Bun floail er ny chur er lheid ny Goan.","Therefore, I hope, it may be of great use and advantage to them, to have [xxxix] such words ready explained to their hands.",

It is for want of consideration that any person or Christian family can live in the disuse of this necessary duty: The most unlearned must know, that they depend upon the goodness of God’s Providence for their health and strength, and for all the comforts and conveniences of life. Men may toil and labour incessantly in the business of their calling; yet all their industry and care, without the Divine blessing will be abortive: for except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it.

The history of Daniel to this purpose is worthy our serious attention, ch. vi. when he was threatened with the loss of his life, if he offered any petition for thirty days, yet he would not be deterred from performing his duty to his great Creator and Preserver, but continued, according to his custom, to pray to God three times a day. For this he was cast into the den of lions; but how wonderfully did God preserve his faithful servant, by shutting up the lions mouths, so that they did him not the least hurt; He who was with Daniel will be with all those who conscientiously wait upon Him; that they shall in the end suffer no loss or harm. And, as Daniel, instead of losing his life, was by this means promoted to higher honour, so those who make a conscience of serving [94] God as they ought, are high in God’s favour, and shall certainly reap some great benefit and advantage by it.",
