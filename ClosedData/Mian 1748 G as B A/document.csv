"6 As hooar Jesse David yn Ree, as hooar David yn Ree Solomon ree-ish v’er ny ve Ben Urias. ",6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
"7 As hooar Solomon Roboam, as hooar Roboam Abia, as hooar Abia Asa. ",7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
"8 As hooar Asa Josaphat, as hooar Josaphat Joram, as hooar Joram Ozias. ",8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
"9 As hooar Ozias Joatham, as hooar Joatham Achaz, as hooar Achaz Ezekias. ",9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
"10 As hooar Ezekias Manasses, as hooar Manasses Amon, as hooar Amon Josias. ",10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
"11 As hooar Josias Jechonias as e vraaraghyn, my-geart y tra va’d goit ersooyl nyn gappeeyn gys Babylon. ","11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:"
