","It was a beautiful afternoon in the season of the harvest in the countryside, and the cornfields were ripe, and the withered hay, up in bunches in the meadows, were looking very grand. The stork was parading about with his long red legs, chattering away in the Egyptian, that she had learned from her mother."
     Va ny maghryn as lheeantyn combaasit lesh keyll mooar as ayns y vean va loghan mooar dy ushtey. ,"The fields and meadows were encompassed by a large forest, and in the middle of the forest was a deep lake of water."

From the house down to the water there were great vivid green leaves, so high that a little child might stand upright under their shade. "
     Va’n boayl cha fadane as çhesh-vean yn cheyll. ,The spot was as isolated as the very centre of the forest.
"     Ayns yn ynnyd shen va thunnag ny hoie guirr, freayl arrey gys yinnagh ny hêin aegey çheet ass ny hoohyn.

","     In that place a duck was sat brooding, watching out until her young chicks would hatch out of the eggs. She was starting to grow tired because the little ones were so long coming out of their shells. "
"     Ec y jerrey ren unnane jeh ny hoohyn brishey. as eisht unnane elley, as magh ass dagh ooh haink cretoor beg bio ren troggal seose e chione as gra “Peep. peep.”","     At last, one of the shells cracked, and soon another, and from each egg came a little living creature that lifted up its head and said “Peep, peep.”"

","     “Quack, quack!” said the mother; and then they all quaked as well as well as they could, while they looked around on every side at the big green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green was good for the eyes."
"     “S’mooar ta’n seihll,” dooyrt ny thunnagyn aegey,  tra hooar ad magh cre woad smoo dy reamys v’ayn ny v’ayns ny hoohyn tra v’ad çheu sthie jeu.","“What a great world it is,” said the young ducks, when they found how much more room there was than there was in the eggshells when they were inside them. "
"  “Vel shiu coontey shoh yn slane seihll?” dooyrt yn voir. “Farkee[1] shiu gys nee shiu fakin yn uhllin as yn garey. Ta’d sheeney magh gys magher yn saggyrt.

Ta mee skee dy liooar jeh traa t’ayn;” agh ren ee soie sheese er yn ooh reesht.","     “Is this all the world, do you imagine?” said the mother. “Wait till you see the farmyard and the garden. They stretch down to the priest’s field. Are you all out?” she said, rising to look. “Not yet; the largest egg is still here. I wonder how long this is to last. I’m tired enough of it now,”” but she sat down on the egg again."
“Cre’n aght ta shiu geddyn er?” dooyrt shenn thunnag va er jeet dy akin ee. ,     “How are you getting on?” said an old duck who came to see her.
"     “Ta un ooh nagh vel guirt foast,” dooyrt ee. “Cha jean ee brishey. Agh jeeagh shiu er y chooid elley. Nagh vel ad ny thunnagyn beggey s’aalin ren shiu rieau fakin?

Aren’t they the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the  image of their father— who is so unfeeling that he doesn’t ever come to visit me!”"
"     “Lhig dou fakin yn ooh nagh jean brishey,” dooyrt yn çhenn thunnag. “Cha vel dooyt erbee. nagh re ooh turkey ee.

I was enticed into hatching some of them once, and after all my care and weariness for the young folk they were afraid to go oin the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I couldn’t get them to go in the water. Let me look at the egg. That is a turkey egg. Take my advice leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim in the water.”"
"“Ta mee kiarail dy hoie urree tammylt beg elley,” dooyrt yn thunnag. “Myr ta mee er hoie choud dy hraa rolaue cha bee red beg dy laghyn elley veg.”","“I’m planning to sit on it a little while longer,” said the duck. “As I have sat so long before, a few days more won’t be anything.”"
"     “Gow dty choyrle hene,” dooyrt yn çhenn thunnag, as hie roie er e raad hene.","     “Very well, please yourself,” said the old duck, and she went her own way.."
"     Ec y jerrey ren yn ooh vooar brishey, as ren eean snaue magh, geam “Peep, peep.” V’eh feer vooar as graney!

Agh nee mayd fakin ayns traa gerrid, tra hig mayd gys yn ushtey. Shegin da goll ayn my she puttey eh ayn nee’m hene.”","     At last the great egg broke, and the chick crawled forth, calling “Peep, peep”. He was very big and ugly! The mother duck stared at him and said. “It’s very big and ugly and it is not at all like any of the others. I wonder if he is a turkey or not. Well, we shall see in a short while, when we get to the water— He must go in, even if I push him in myself.”"
" Er yn nah laa va’n ghrian soilshean dy sollys, as ren yn voir thunnag goaill ad gys yn ushtey as lheim ayn ec cheayrt.  “Quank.

","On the next day Tte sun shone brightly, and the mother duck took them to the water and jumped at once. “Quack, quack!” she said, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water covered their heads, but they came up again and swam about very abley, driving themselves with their legs easy enough, and the ugly duckling was also in the water, swimming around in the water."
"     “Ah,” dooyrt yn voir, “cha vel eh shen Turkey. Cre cha mie as t’eh gobbragh e chassyn, as cre cha jeeragh as t’eh cummal eh-hene.

How well he uses his legs, and how erect he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not that ugly after all, if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! Come with me now. I will take you to grand society around the the farmer’s house, but you must keep very close to me because you may be trodden underfoot; above all, beware of the cat.”"
"     Tra ren ad roshtyn gys yn uhllin, va lane arganey ayn; daa lught-thie, streeu mysh kione astan, va ec y jerrey currit lesh ersooyl ec y chayt. “Jeeagh shiu paitçhyn, shoh myr ta cliaghtey yn seihll,” dooyrt yn voir thunnag, gushtagh e beeal, son veagh ee er ve booiagh geddyn yn kione astan ee hene. “Tar-jee nish.

You must bow your heads to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all and has Spanish blood; therefore she is well off. Don’t you see she has a red rag tied to her leg, which is something very grand and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, and that she may be noticed by both man and beast. Come, now, don’t turn in your toes; but spread your feet wide apart, just like your father and mother, in this way; now bend your necks and say ‘Quack!'”"
"     Ren ny thunnagyn aegey jannoo myr ren ee gordrail daue, agh va ny thunagyn elley jeeaghyn dy geyre orroo, as gra rish y chelley, “Jeagh ayns shen, ta aalagh elley dy hunnagyn aegey çheet— myr nagh row dy liooar ayn ro-laue!

","     The ducklings did as they were bade, but the other ducks stared at them, and said to each other, “Look there, another brood of ducklings are coming—as if there weren’t enough before! And what a queer one one of them is. We don’t want him there here”; and then one of them flew out and bit him on the neck."
"     “Faag void eh,” dooyrt y voir, “cha vel eh jannoo assee erbee.” ","     “Let him alone,” said the mother; “he is not doing any harm.”"
"     “Ta, agh t’eh cha mooar as cha graney,” doort yn thunnag spiteoilagh, “as shegin da ve currit magh.”","     “Yes, but he is so big and ugly,” said the spiteful duck, “and he must be turned out.”"
"“Ta ny paitçhyn elley feer aalin,” doyrt yn çhenn thunnag lesh yn chlooid jiarg er e cass. “Ooilley agh yn fer shen. Bare lhiam dy voddagh y voir jannoo eh red beg s’aalin.”","     “The otherschildren are very pretty,” said the old duck with the red rag on her leg, “All but that one. I’d rather if his mother could make him a bit prettier.”"
"“Ta shen neu-phossible,” dooyrt yn voir. “Cha vel eh feer aalin, agh t’eh lhiannoo feer vie, as snaue ayns yn ushtey kiart cha mie as yn feallagh elley, as red beg share.

Shen-y-fa, cha vel eh monney madyr. Ta mish coontey dy jean eh gaase seose lajer son dy goaill kiarail jeh hene.”","“That is impossible, your grace,” said the mother. “He is not pretty, but he is a very good child, and swims just as well as the others, and even better. I think he will grow up pretty yet. He has been too much time in the egg, and that is why he isn’t formed very well;” and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying: “It is a drake. Therefore he is not of so much consequence. I reckon he will grow up strong for taking care of himself.”"
"“Ta ny thunnagyn elley jesh dy liooar,” dooyrt yn çhenn thunnag. “Nish jean shiu shiu hene ec y thie. as my nee shiu geddyn kione astan cur lesh hym’s eh.”","     “The other ducklings are nice enough,” said the old duck. “Now make yourself at home, and if you find an eel’s head you can bring it to me.”"
"     Myr shen ren ad jannoo ad hene ec y thie as va’d feer souyr; agh yn eean boght ren snaue ass yn ooh yn fer s’jerree jeh ooilley as va jeeaghyn cha graney, v’eh er ny vingey as er ny phuttey as lane faghid er ny yannoo jeh, cha nee liorish ny thunnagyn ny lomarkan, agh liorish kiarkyn as ooilley. ","     And so they made themselves at home and they were very comfortable; but the poor duckling who had crept out of his shell last of all and looked so ugly; he was nipped and pushed and made a lot of fun of, not only by the ducks but by hens and all."
"     “T’eh ro vooar,” v’ad ooilley gra; as yn kellagh turkey, quoi va er ve ruggit ayns yn seihll lesh spyrryn er, as coontey eh-hene ardreiltagh, ren sheiddey eh-hene magh myr lhong fo slane shiaull as ren getlagh er yn thunnag voght, as jannoo eh-hene jairg lesh sproght, myr shen cha row fys ec yn red beg boght cre’n raad dy gholl, as v’eh feer veevaynrey. ","     “He is too big,” they were all saying; and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs and fancied himself really a ruler, puffed himself out like a ship in full sail and flew at the poor duck, he made himself red with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable. "
"     Myr shen v’eh goll er voish laa gys laa, gys ren eh gaase ny smessey as ny smessey, gys va’n eean  thunnag voght eiyrit mygeayrt ec dy chooilley unnane; as va eer e vraaraghyn as e huyraghyn neu-ghoogysagh da as gra rish. “y Chretoor graney, bare lhiam jinnagh yn kayt goaill oo.” As va e voir yeearee nagh row eh rieau er ve ruggit.

","     So it went on from day to day; until it got worse and worse, until the poor duckling was driven about by every one; and even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him and said to him, “Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you” and his mother wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the hen chicks were beating him, and the girl who fed them was pushing him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds that were on the hedge when he flew over."
"     “T’ad ayns aggle roym son dy vel mee cha graney,” dooyrt eh.

So he shut his eyes as flew farther off, until he came to a spot that was very desolate, rushes and water, where there were many wild ducks dwelling. There he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful."
"     Ayns yn voghrey, tra ren ny thunnagyn feïe troggal ayns yn aer, ghow ad baght jeh nyn gomraag noa. “Cre’n cheint dy hunnag shuish?” dooyrt ad ooilley, çheet mygeayrt-y-mysh. ","    In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. “What sort of a duck are you?” they all said, coming round him."
"     Ren e croamey y chione aghtal dy liooar, agh cha ren eh cur ansoor erbee daue. “Ta shiu erskyn thowse graney,”  dooyrt ny thunnagyn feïe, “agh cha vel shen madyr mannagh jean shiu poosey veg jeh’n lughtthie ainyn.”","     He bowed his head fine enough, but he did not give them any answer “You are exceedingly ugly,” said the wild ducks; “but that does not matter if you do not marry any of our family.”"
"Yn red boght. Cha row eh smooinagh er poosey; ooilley ny v’eh laccal va keid dy lhie fud ny shuinyn as dy iu paart jeh’n ushtey er yn reeastane.

He wasn’t thinking of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they weren’t long out of their eggs,  but they were very impertinent. “Listen, friend,” said one of them to the duckling; “you are so ugly that I like you very well. Will you go with us, and go over the ocean? Not far from here, where there is another moor, in there there are many very pretty wild geese, that aren’t married yet. It is a chance for you to get a wife. You may make be lucky yet, ugly as you are.”"

","     “Bang, bang,” he heard in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was reddened with their blood. After that, there was nothing but “Bang, bang,” to be heard far and wide, and several wild geese rose up from the rushes."
"As va’n sheean ry-chlashtyn ayns dy chooilley ayrn jeh’n reeastane, son va ny shelgeyryn er chombaasal yn reestane as va paart jeu ny hoie er banglanyn ny biljyn va erskyn ny shuinyn.

The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the  trees, and many dogs were going around among the rushes. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide himself, and at the same moment a dog came near him with his jaws open and his tongue hanging from his mouth, and his eyes glaring like fire. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then he went into the water, without doing him harm."
"     Ren yn thunnag osnaghey, gra; “Cre cha booisal as ta mish dy vel mee cha graney; cha jean moddey hene greimmey mee.” ","     The duck sighed, saying; “how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.”"

","And so he lay still, while the hunters’ shots sounded through the rushes, whilst gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became peaceful, but even then the poor thing was afraid to move. He waited calmly for a long time, and then he hastened to get away from the moor. He ran over the fields and meadows till a great storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against the wind."

","  Towards evening he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only seemed to remain standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The duckling could go no farther. He sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed, in consequence of one of the hinges being broken, and there was a narrow opening at the bottom  of the door, but is was large enough for him to get through, and he went through the opening very quietly, and so got a shelter for that night. There was an old woman, a tom-cat, and a hen living in the house. The tom-cat, who his mistress called “My little son,” she thought of him as a pet (???); he could raise his back, and purr, and throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very, very short legs, she called her “Chickie Short-legs.” She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child."
     Ayns y voghery va’n fer joarree er ny gheddyn magh. As ren yn kayt goaill toshiaght dy whirral as yn chiark dy chluckal.,  In the morning the strange visitor was discovered; the cat began to purr and the hen to cluck.

","What is this all this noise for?” said the old woman, looking around about the room. But her sight was not very good; therefore when she saw the fat duckling she thought it had gone astray. “I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some ducks’ eggs. I must wait and see.”So the duckling was allowed to stay in the house for three weeks; but there weren’t any eggs."
"Nish va’n kayt Mainshter yn thie, as va’n chiark yn venainshter; as v’ad dy mennick gra,  “Shinnyn as yn seihll,” son v’ad credjal ad hene dy ve leih jeh’n seihll,  as yn leih share neesht.

","Now the cat was the master of the house, and the hen was the mistress; and they often said, “We and the world,” for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half, too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts."
“Vel shiu son breh oohyn?” ren ee briaght,     “Can you lay eggs?” she asked. 
     “Cha vod.”,     “No.” 
“Eisht bee shiu mie dy liooar dy ve nyn dost.”,“Then will you be good enough to be quiet.”

Don’t imagine such nonsense, child, and give thanks for  your good fortune to the old woman; that you have been received here. Are you not in a comfortable room, and in society from which you may learn something? But you are a chat often, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your good.

","     One evening, just as the sun was setting, several beautiful birds came out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them in all his life. They were swans; and they curved their graceful necks, and their beautiful plumage was as white as snow. They called with voice that he had never heard before as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from the cold to hot countries across the sea. And as they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt a desire to go with them as he watched them.. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds! And when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds nor where they had gone, but he never such an attraction towards any other bird in the world."

At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he swam in it, and the duckling had to paddle his legs to keep it from freezing. He became exhausted at last and lay still, and he was frozen fast in the ice."

Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He flew into a butter cask, and back out and into a meal tub and out again. What a condition he was in then! The woman screamed and struck at him with the tongs; the children were laughing and running around shouting and rolling over each other in their efforts to catch him, but he got away. The door was wide open; and the poor creature got out among the bushes and lay down curled up on the snow."

They bore him onwards until he found himself in a very large garden where apple trees were in full blossom, and the elder trees stretched their long green branches down to the stream, which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything looked beautiful and grand in the early spring. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds he saw rising from the rushes and felt more unhappy than ever."

He had been despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder tree bent down its boughs into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers and curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully from the depths of his heart, “I never dreamed of such happiness as this while I was a despised ugly duckling."
