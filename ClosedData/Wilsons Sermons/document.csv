And I see plainly, from what I have heard this day, that my Repentance will signify very little, if I do not bring forth fruits answerable to amendment of life. Is it not a great mercy, that God will accept of a sinner’s repentance, after he has done so many ill things? Is it not great condescension in the Son of God to give us even his oath that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men; and that none ought to despair of mercy, but such only as will not be persuaded to forsake their evil ways? What a mercy is it that I have time to repent, and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. And what a foolish, what a wretched creature should I be, if I should neglect such a mercy, and go on in my sins, and to my destruction? I will therefore, through the Grace of God, not defer my repentance for one moment, lest I be overtaken in sin, and be for ever undone. ",,,

You may, indeed, do so; but if you have any concern for your own soul, you will think better of it, and reason with yourself after some such manner as this: —I now see the great sin of neglecting so necessary a duty as is this of Prayer. I see plainly, that I must renounce all pretence to religion, all hopes of salvation, if I neglect it any longer. I am convinced, that all the sins I ever committed, and which I have not confessed and begged pardon for, do stand in judgment against me. And what will become of me if I die in this condition? —And I have all the reason in the world to believe, that God will withhold his blessings from me, if I do not give him thanks for those I have already received. I have no reason to hope for God’s protection and blessing upon myself, upon my children, or upon my labours, when I never pray for them. I am as subject to afflictions, to troubles, to calamities, as other people: How shall I bear them with patience without the assistance of God’s grace? How shall I escape the many temptations to wickedness which I meet with daily, without praying for God’s help and direction? In short, if I neglect this duty, how shall I escape eternal misery? —I am resolved what to do. —I will, by the grace of Almighty God, omit this duty of prayer no longer, lest I come short of Heaven, and be for ever undone. [5] I will, as I have been instructed, take all occasions of praying to God. When I set about any business of moment, I will pray him to prosper my honest endeavours. Whenever I shall perceive that I have done any thing amiss, I will forthwith pray God to forgive me, and to give me grace to do so no more. If I am in trouble, or in distress, I will apply to the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort. If I am in any danger, I will pray him to deliver me: if I am tempted to any sin, I will beseech him to succour me. And I will not fail to give him thanks, whenever he bestows any blessing upon me.

","Let us again suppose, that the sermon which you have heard has been concerning the meaning, and benefit, and duty, of receiving the lord’s supper. A serious person can hardly choose but make some such observations and resolutions as these: —I have this day been invited to partake of the Lord’s Supper;— an ordinance appointed by Christ himself, and for this reason: —That Christians being often called upon to remember the love of their dying Saviour, and the occasion of his death, which was to make their peace with God, they might love him with all their soul, and remember to observe the commands he has given them, in order to fit them for Heaven. I am assured, that this is the only way to render our persons and our prayers acceptable to God; of obtaining the pardon of our sins, the grace of God, and everlasting life after death. I understand what duties are required to make me a worthy guest at that holy table. I must resolve to forsake those sins which cost Jesus Christ his life: And I must forgive, and love, and do good to others, since he has been so good and so kind to me, as to lay down his very life for me. I dare not, therefore, I will not, turn my back upon an ordinance upon which my salvation depends. If I am not fit to go to this sacrament, I am sure that I am not in the way of life; I must be under God’s displeasure. I have nothing, therefore, to do, but what through God’s grace I will endeavour to do: And this is —to prepare myself as well as I am able; and for the rest, to trust in the mercy and goodness of my Saviour, to supply, by his grace, what is wanting on my part. And I shall easily know whether I have been a worthy communicant or not, by the life I lead afterwards. ",,,

I see how blind those people are, who hope to go to Heaven with[6]out endeavouring to please God and to keep his commandments. I hope I shall never forget a truth I have heard this day— that Religion, and the way to please God, does not consist so much in observing the outward duties of Christianity, as in leading an holy life. I see plainly, that a man may go to the church, and to the sacrament, without being just, or humble, or devout, or temperate or charitable. And that the reason why we go to church, and pray to God, and hear his word, is this— that we may obtain his grace to enable us to lead a sober, a righteous, and a godly life. This, therefore, through the grace of God, shall be my great endeavour for the time to come, —to walk worthy of the religion I profess, and of the hopes I have of being happy when I die. ",,,

In short, I see plainly, that now is the time in which I am to chuse what I am to be, for ever and ever.

If tipling, if squandering away my time or estate, if gluttony or drunkenness, have been the sins I have lived in, these must be repented of and utterly forsaken, let it be never so uneasy to flesh and blood, or I shall have no part in the kingdom of Heaven.",,,

I see too, that all the commands of God, all the duties which he has prescribed us, are all intended in mercy to keep us from ruining ourselves. And that if we had been suffered to follow our own wills, or the evil customs we contract, or the bad examples we meet with, we could not escape bringing upon ourselves destruction. I am left, therefore, without excuse, and I shall dearly pay for if I do not deny myself every thing which God has forbidden me; and if I do not look upon his commands as the only way to life and happiness everlasting.",,,

They explain to you the commands of God, which are designed to make you happy for ever. And they put you in remembrance of the promises of God, if you be obedient; and of his severe threatenings, if you despise his goodness.

In order to this, I will often call to mind the many blessings which I have received from God, that I may give him thanks for them, the surest way to increase my love for him who has been so good and kind to me. I will read or hear his Holy Word with care, that I may know his will, his promises, and the great reward he has proposed to his faithful servants. I will abhor and avoid all such persons, principles, company, and conversation, as may lessen my esteem for and love of God. I will not let the love of the world possess my heart, lest I forget God, and forget that he is my only good. And because love amongst friends is soon lost for want of conversing with one another, I will go to God daily, and lay my wants and my desires before him: particularly, I will beg of God to pour into my heart such love towards him, that I may love him above all things, and that his love may be the commanding principle of my life.

And they are pleased with such men, and such arguments, as tend to lessen their belief of a future state, and a future account. So dreadful is the sin of hating i. e. of not loving God.",,,

You will be careful, therefore, to remember what you have learned from Christ himself, as well as from his Ministers; i. e. whom you are to account your neighbour, and how you are to shew your love to him.",,,

That the poor shall depend upon the rich for their subsistence; and the rich, whatever they think of it, shall receive a greater advantage from the prayers of the poor. You will then call to mind how you are to express your love to your neighbour. The command says, you are to love him as yourself. You know, without a teacher, how you love yourself. That you wish and take satisfaction in your own welfare and prosperity. That you are sorry when any evil or mischief befals yourself. You do not love to have your own faults aggravated, or your good name abused; and how ready you are to find excuses for your own mistakes. In short, you know very well how you would have others to shew their love for you. And that it is no small comfort for the ignorant and unlearned, that their duty is contained in so few words, and that they can easily understand it, by considering how they love, how they would be dealt with, themselves.",,,

I will therefore do no wrong to any man, though I could hope to be never so great a gainer by it. I will not oppress, over-reach, vex, or harrass others, though it should be in my power. I will not envy my neighbour’s prosperity, nor bear malice in my heart, though I could never so well conceal it. I will despise no man living for the meanness of his condition, or for the misfortunes that may have befallen him; knowing very well, that we are all subject to misfortunes, to failings, to every thing that may make a man contemptible. I will be ready to do good with what God has blessed me, and even glad to communicate, knowing that with such sacrifices God is pleased. I will not render evil for evil, though revenge is sweet to flesh and blood. If any man is my enemy without cause, I will pray that God would convert him; that he will restrain and keep him from evil and mischief, which otherwise will be the greatest injury to himself. I will not say, that my neighbour does not deserve my love; for if God should deal with me according to my deserts, I should be the most miserable creature alive. I will not dare to say, such a man has injured me, and I will not forgive him; because God himself has declared, that just so he will deal with me. I will bear with the infirmities of others, hoping that others, and especially God himself, will bear with mine. I will thus endeavour to express my love to my neighbour out of love to God, who has commanded me so to do; and because I believe it will be most acceptable to the Divine Majesty. And I will beg of God to give me the spirit of love; and that the love of God, and of my neighbour, may be the commanding principle of my life. And, that every night of my life I may lie down to sleep with the same charitable dispositions with which I desire and hope to die.",,,

And, that we are heirs of salvation on no other terms but these: That we study to please God in the whole course of our lives; and that we must not satisfy ourselves with the outward duties of religion, which are of no value in the sight of God, if they do not help to free us from the slavery of sin, and restore us to the image of God.",,,

That to lead a careless, thoughtless, or a useless life, will certainly bring upon me the sentence of the fruitless tree; “cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground.” I will therefore endeavour to please God, by being as careful of my ways, and as obedient, to his commands, as his grace shall enable me to be. And since he is so good as to allow me to call him my father, I will endeavour to lead such a life as becomes the child of so holy a father. To this end, I will endeavour to understand what the will of God is, and will compare my life with those rules he has given me to walk by, that I may be satisfied whether I am, in truth, in the way of holiness or not. I will not delude myself with saying, that every man has his faults, and that God is merciful: For I understand he is just as well as merciful; that he hates sin in every body; and that if my faults are such as he hates, and has forbidden, and I continue in them, I shall provoke him to deny me the benefit of his mercy, and shall feel the severity of his justice. I will not therefore, as I love my own soul, live in any known sin, but will keep a strict watch over my heart and actions, and deny myself, and part with, any pleasure rather than displease God. Nor will I flatter myself with vain hopes, that I may get habits of holiness hereafter, and before I die; for if I think it too soon to please God now, he may be provoked to deny me his grace, and then I shall never be holy, never happy.",,,

This is the only security against the greatest crimes: To be afraid of those judgments which he has threatened to sinners, and of those ways which he has assured us will be our ruin. I will not, therefore, go against my conscience in the least thing whatever; being throughly convinced, that I cannot take up when I please. I see the danger of continuing in any known sin; if therefore I shall be so unhappy as to fall into sin, I will follow the example of holy David—I made haste (said he) and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

At the same time, God has given me to understand, that before I can be fit for Heaven, my nature must be changed; that I must love him with all my heart and soul, and that, for his sake, I must love all mankind, otherwise I cannot be admitted into that blessed society. He has also shewed me the way how I may attain these holy dispositions, which are so absolutely necessary to fit me for Heaven. That in order to love him with all my heart, I must believe in him, and give entire credit to every thing which he has made known to us. That I must fear him —fear to do any thing that I believe will displease him. That I must obey him—do what he has commanded, and avoid what he has forbidden. That I must submit to all his choices for me, and endeavour that my heart may always go along with my lips in this petition—thy will be done. That I must give him the honour due unto his name; speak of him with reverence; worship him with great devotion; pray to him for what I want; and give him praise and thanks for all his mercies. [28] And lastly, that I must close with the means of grace which he has ordained for my edification, and by which he will give me the earnest of his holy spirit. By observing these rules, I shall come to love God with all my heart, and be qualified for that happiness for which he created me.",,,

Such is that of our Saviour’s; [Matth. vii. 12.] “whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets:” which, though a general rule, may by a well-meaning Christian, [34] be applied to all our dealings one with another; while those that are resolved to be rich, whatever shall be the consequence, all the rules of the Gospel, though never so well explained, will be of little use to them.[31] But for such as do really make a conscience of their ways, one would endeavour to make their way plain and safe.",,,

And this is—to take such a gain, advantage, or consideration, as the person with whom I deal would be satisfied with, if he knew my business as well as I do myself, and the reasons which oblige me to take such a profit. Whoever makes this his rule, his conscience will never reproach him of injustice. But if, instead of doing so, men will take all that they can get; make an hand of the ignorance, necessities, or simplicity, of those with whom they deal, they do what they must know to be unjust, and make themselves liable to one of the most difficult duties of Christianity, —and that is, Restitution, without which their repentance will not be accepted of God.",,,

All that conceal the faults of the goods they sell. All that cheat or over-reach those they deal with. All that by any wicked artifice defraud their creditors of what is their due. All that by smuggling of goods, forswearing themselves, or bribing others, with-hold from the King any part of his customs or other revenues, which the laws of God and of the land have given him a just right to.

I will not, therefore, let the love of the world possess my soul, lest it choke the seed of God’s word sown in my heart, and those truths which should keep me from ruin. Such as these: “He that hasteth to be rich, can hardly be innocent.” [Prov. xxviii. 2[0].] That all depends upon the blessing of God, which cannot be hoped for in unrighteous ways. That every man living has a right to be dealt with fairly and with justice. That neither life, nor happiness, consisteth in the abundance any man possesseth. That it will be no advantage to a man to have doubled his talents, if at the same time he has doubled his guilt. That posterity will feel the effects of my injustice; God having declared, that he will lay up the iniquities of sinners for their children.

They hear the most gracious terms of pardon declared, and the absolution pronounced, without receiving the comfort and benefit [38] thereof. They repeat the most divine and powerful prayer of our Lord, without considering the majesty of Him to whom they speak, or his wonderful goodness in permitting them to come to him as to a father. They repeat his praises in the psalms and hymns without any true devotion; and they hear his word, his commands, his promises, and his judgments, without being moved by them to mend their lives.",,,

Or if this sentence shall be read— “Turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,” &c. —say secretly, God grant that I may never abuse this goodness and patience of God, which is designed to lead me to repentance. While this sentence is reading— “I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,” &c. —think with yourself with what an humble, penitent heart this poor prodigal said these words, and endeavour to possess your own heart with the same devout affections. Lastly, when this sentence shall be read— “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,” &c. —a devout and penitent soul will pour out some such secret ejaculation as this: The very best of men have need of mercy and pardon; how much more such a miserable sinner as I am! —“I will acknowledge my sin unto God, and mine iniquities will I not hide.”",,,

Many hold the truth in unrighteousness; many run into sinful pleasures; others suffer the cares of the world to take up all their thoughts and time; while others, who yet think their time innocently spent, are engaged in studies which have no relation to the one thing needful.

He sees very plainly, that he cannot deliver himself from the wrath of an angry God. He is so far from being able to make any satisfaction for the sins he has been guilty of, that he finds in himself a proneness, an inclination to evil; and an aversion, an unwillingness, to close with what God has commanded us for our good. This is the condition of a sinner; this is the condition of every man by nature; and a sad condition it will appear to be to every one, who knows and considers, that the end of sin is not to be seen in this life; but that a day is coming, in which God will judge the world in righteousness, and give to every man according to the works done in the body.",,,

Accordingly; when our Blessed Saviour came amongst men, he invited such only to be his hearers, to whom he knew his doctrine would be acceptable: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.” And when he was blamed for conversing too freely with publicans and sinners, he silenced his adversaries with this reason and answer: “They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”",,,

And therefore, when a certain publican, to testify the sincerity of his repentance, resolved to part with his estate rather than not do every body right, that he had before wronged, Jesus Christ assures him, that his having been a greater sinner than ordinary will be no hindrance to his salvation: “For the Son of Man,” saith he, “is come to seek and to save that which is lost.” [Luke xix. 10.] That is, such as out of a sense of their misery apply to Him for health and salvation.",,,

Human laws, fear of shame, of reproach, and many other worldly considerations, may restrain a man from crimes that other people are guilty of; and yet, such a man may be an utter stranger to the fear of God. Whereas such as truly fear God, are not led thereto by any earthly consideration whatever; but they have seriously considered their own great corruption, and God’s infinite purity; their own sad deserts, and God’s severe justice; they cannot but acknowledge the justice and holiness of his laws, and yet they find in themselves an unwillingness to obey them. They are sure that without God’s grace they cannot do anything that is good; and yet they find in themselves a strange backwardness even to ask that favour and assistance. They know, that they live upon his bounty, and yet they cannot find in their hearts to be thankful. These are both instances of great disorder, and must needs make them liable to God’s displeasure. They profess to believe, “that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good;” and yet they are apt to sin as presumptuously as if they were indeed hid from his sight. They hear how severely he threatens those that transgress his laws. They have seen his judgments upon other sinners, and they know not how soon it may be their own case.",,,

They cannot fly from his presence; they dare not stand upon their innocency; they see that sorrow and tears, and asking forgiveness, will not prevail, with an earthly judge to pardon criminals, when their crimes are only against men like themselves; and why should they suppose that God will not avenge the presumptuous breach of his laws, and affronts against his Divine Majesty?",,,

For it was to people thus affected and thus disposed, that Jesus Christ spoke, when he said, “Come unto me, all that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” And indeed it is purely for want of such dispositions as these, that the Gospel is preached without effect; that Jesus Christ, and salvation through faith in him, is offered even to us Gentiles, who before were in darkness, and in the shadow of death; and we scarce esteem it a favour, because we are not sensible of the sad estate we are in without the blessing of a Redeemer.",,,

You see how people come to differ; some believing, and others slighting, the very same truths.

In short, they could not say what would convince them, if neither a doctrine worthy of God, nor works which none but God could do, were not sufficient.

Is it not that we may awake out of sleep? That we may see the danger we are in, and overcome all difficulties, for a few days, that we may escape being miserable for ever? And that we may be encouraged to do so, the Spirit of God has assured us, that our reward shall be great hereafter; our comfort in the mean time such as cannot be expressed; and that we shall have such assistance as shall enable us to overcome all difficulties. We have, therefore, but this choice, either to follow our own inclinations for a while, and be miserable for ever; or to obey the will of God (though we meet with uneasiness) that we may obtain his favour, and be eternally happy. And it is mere [118] folly to expect any other issue of our obedience or disobedience. For thus God has dealt with men since the world began: Such as obeyed him, with their whole hearts, found their advantage in it; and such as followed their own wicked imaginations, were rejected of God, and delivered up to destruction.",,,

In particular, he has declared, that to the impenitent and unbelievers no mercy shall be shewn, whatever they may hope for. And that we may not mistake his meaning, he has plainly told us, true penitents are such as “bring forth fruits meet for repentance;” and that true faith is such as purifieth the heart. So that if this word be the rule by which God will judge us, and by which we may judge whether we are out of danger or not, we see plainly, that the mercy of God will be of no advantage to us, while we knowingly transgress his laws.

Always remembering, “that without holiness no man shall see the Lord.” That the duties of Christianity are indispensable; that God did never excuse any one of his servants, from the beginning of the world to this day, from observing them faithfully. “That no man can serve two masters;” so that it is in vain to call myself a servant of God, when I do not the things which he has commanded",,,
Lhig dooin consideral ny sodjey: —,"Let us consider farther,[39] that if we meet with temptations, it was designed we should do so, that we might thereby be obliged to depend more entirely upon God. That if we are sometimes at a loss, it is so ordered, that we may look up to God for light and salvation. That “if we love darkness rather than light,” it is no wonder if we miss our way, and are bewildered. That if we want hearts to set about the work of our salvation in good earnest, it is because we know, in our consciences, that we never sincerely prayed to God to give us grace to do so. That if we are careless because the rest of the world are so, and hope to come off as well as others, it is because we do not consider, that it will be no comfort to be damned for company, no more than it would be pleasure to be poor, or sick, or tormented here, for company.",,,

That want of capacity cannot be pretended, when we understand things much more difficult to be known. That to put off the concern of our souls to the last, is plainly to value them less than anything else. That to think ourselves safe, because we do not fear any danger, is to be ignorant of a great truth, which is—that people [119] may be given over to a reprobate mind, i.e. a mind void of judgment. Lastly; that such pretences as these will rather increase our guilt, than serve to obtain our pardon, when we appear before God. And the conclusion will be, that he who seeks out excuses for not living as becomes the Gospel of Christ, is only contriving how to shut himself out of Heaven.",,,

He that dares not do this may depend upon it, he is not in the way of salvation. And he that is once fully persuaded, that without a sincere repentance, a lively faith, and an unfeigned charity, he cannot be saved, will never think of making excuses to free himself from these duties, and the fruit of them—holiness of life. For a man to be at ease upon any other account, or to hope that any thing in the world will atone for want of true piety, is to hope without reason and without scripture. ",,,
