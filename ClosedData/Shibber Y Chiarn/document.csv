SECTION 1.,CAB. I

"THERE are two Holy Ordinances or Sacraments appointed by Jesus Christ as most especial Means of obtaining Grace and Salvation: Which no Christian, Who hopes to be saved must wilfully neglect.—These are Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper.","TA daa Oardaghey Casherick ny daa Sacrament curmit orrin liorish Yeesey Creest myr ny ard Saaseyn dy chosney Grayse as Saualtys: Ad shoh cha nhegin da Creestee erbee, ta jerkal rish Saualtys, dy meerioosagh lhiggey shaghey. T’ad shoh Bashtey as Shibber y Chiarn."
,
"It must be supposed, that you have already been made Partaker of one of these two Sacraments, viz. That of Baptism, by which you [2] were admitted into the Congregation of Christ’s Flock,—were restored to the Favour of God,—and had the Holy Spirit communicated to you, for a Principle of a new and spiritual Life; in order to awaken you, and to direct and assist that natural Reason, with which God has endued all Mankind.","Shegin goaill ass laue dy vel unnane jeh’n daa Sacrament shoh hannah shirveishit ort,—ta shen dy ghra, Yn Sacrament dy Vashtey, liorish v’ou er [2] dty ghoaill stiagh ayns Sheshaght Shioltane Chreest,—troggit reesht gys Foayr Yee,—as Bree yn Spyrryd Noo er ny choyrt dhyt son Undin as Toshiaght dy Vea noa as spyrrydoil; dy ghreinnaghey oo, as dy leeideil as dy niartaghey yn Resoon dooghyssagh shen, lesh ta Jee er choamrey ooilley Sheelnaue."
"But forasmuch as you have done many Things contrary to the Promise made in your Name, when you were baptized,—and will stand in need of greater Degrees of Grace and Assistance, to enable you to resist the Temptations of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and to do your Duty in that State of Life, unto which the Providence of God shall call you:—You are therefore now called upon to be Partaker of the other Sacrament,—That of the Lord’s Supper; by which, upon your sincere Repentance, you may obtain the Pardon of all your past Sins, and such other Graces as you stand in need of, to bring you to eternal Life and Happiness.","Agh son wheesh as dy vel oo er n’yannoo ymmodee Reddyn noi yn Ghialdyn va jeant ayns dty Ennym ec dty Vashtey, as dy bee oo feme towse smoo dy Ghrayse as dy Chooney, dy niartaghey oo dy hassoo magh noi Miolaghyn y Theihll, yn Eill, as y Drogh-spyrryd, as dy yannoo dty Churrym ayns y Stayd shen dy Vea, huggey nee Ard-chiarail Yee geamagh ort:—T’ou nish er-y-fa shen er dty chuirrey dy ghoaill Ayrn jeh’n Sacrament elley,—Sacrament Shibber y Chiarn; liorish shen my nee oo Arrys firrinagh y ghoaill, foddee oo Leih y gheddyn son ooilley ny Peccaghyn t’ou rieau er n’yannoo, as lheid ny Grayseyn elley ta feme ayd orroo, dy leeideil oo gys y Vea Veayn as Maynrys dy bragh farraghtyn."
,
,
"Take care therefore, that you understand what you are called to as well as you are able, and God expects no more.— [3]","Shen-y fa gow Kiarail, dy hoiggal chammah as oddys oo [yn Oardaghey Casherick] shen huggey t’ou er dty eam, as ny smoo cha vel Jee dy hirrey.— [3]"
"For if you go to the Lord’s Supper without considering the Reason of that Ordinance, and the very great Concern you have in it, without seeing the Necessity and Blessing of a Redeemer, you will go with Indifference, and return without such Benefit as you might otherwise hope for.","Son my t’ou goll gys Shibber y Chiarn fegooish Toiggal cooie ayd jeh’n Oardaghey shen, as y Cosney feer vooar ta ayd liorish,—gyn tastey ayd jeh Ymmyrch as Bannaght Fer-kionnee, hed oo gys y Chreestiaght lesh beggan Scansh, as chyndaa-ee oo veih fegooish lheid y Vondeish as oddagh oo er aght elley treishteil er y hon."
"To prevent this you should seriously consider what Account the Holy Scriptures have given us of the Condition we are in, both with respect to this Life, and the Life which is to come.","Dy haghney shoh lhisagh oo smooinaghtyn dy dowin er y Coontey ta Goo Casherick Yee er chur dooin jeh’n Stayd ta shin ayn, chammah ‘sy Vea shoh, as jeh shen ta ry-heet."
"That is,—That we are by Nature Sinners: and that, as such, God cannot take Pleasure in us:—And that if we die, before we are restored to his Favour, we shall be separated from him, and miserable for ever.","Ta shen dy ghra,—Liorish Dooghys dy vel shin Peccee: as myr ta shin Peccee, nagh vod Jee Taitnys y ghoaill aynin:—As my yiow mayd Baase roish my jig mayd ayns Foayr rish, dy bee mayd er nyn scarrey veih, as ayns Treihys er son dy bragh."
"This will lead you to inquire, how the Nature of Man came to be thus disordered, and prone to Evil; for you must not imagine, that God, who is infinitely good, created Man in such a State of Corruption, as you now see and feel him to be in; but that he must have fallen into this wretched Condition, since he came out of the Hands of his Creator. [4]","Leeidee shoh oo dy vriaght, kys haink Dooghys Dooinney gys y Stayd varvaanagh shoh, as aggindagh er Olk; son cha nhegin dhyt smooinaghtyn, dy ren Jee, ta erskyn-earroo mie, Dooinney y chroo ayns lheid y Stayd pheccoil, as t’ou nish fakin as gennaghtyn eh nish dy ve ayn; agh dy nhegin da ve er huittym ayns y Stayd hreih shoh, lurg da v’er jeet ass Laueyn e Er-croo. [4]"
"And so the Scripture informs us.—In the third Chapter of Genesis, we have this following Account of the State of Man, Before, and After the Fall:","As myr shen ta Goo Yee ginsh dooin.—Ayns y trass Chabdil jeh Lioar Genesis, ta’n Coontey shoh ain jeh Stayd Dooinney, Roish, as Lurg da tuittym ayns Peccah:"
"That Adam and Eve, from whom sprang all Mankind, were created in the Image of God; that is, holy and innocent, having a perfect Knowledge of their Duty, a Command of their Will and Affections, and a Power, through the Grace of God, to do what they saw fit to be done.","Dy row Adam as Aue, jeu rug ooilley Sheelnaue, er nyn groo ayns Caslys Yee; ta shen, casherick as gyn-loght, lesh Tushtey firrinagh jeh nyn Gurrym, lesh Smaght harrish nyn Aigney as nyn Yeearreeyn, as Pooar trooid Grayse Yee, dy yannoo shen heeagh ad cooie dy ve jeant."
"In this Condition they were placed in Paradise, in a State of Trial, with a Promise of immortal Life and Happiness, if they should continue to Fear, to Love, to Honour and Obey their Creator; as also, with an express Warning of the dreadful Consequence of their Disobedience.","Ayns y Stayd shoh v’ad soit ayns Pargeiys, er-chee dy phrowal ad, lesh Gialdyn jeh Bea veayn as Maynrys, my yinnagh ad tannaghtyn dy ghoaill Aggie roish, dy chur Graih, Ooashley as Biallys da nyn Ver-croo; lesh Raaue geyre myrgeddin jeh’n Jerrey atchimagh harragh er nyn Meer-viallys."
"Notwithstanding which Warning, they, through the Temptation of the Devil, transgressed the Commands of God; and by doing so, they did not only forfeit all Right to the Promise of eternal Life and Happiness, but also contracted such a Blindness in the Understanding, such a Disorder in their Will and Affections, as all their Posterity feel to their Sorrow; and became subject to Sin, and the Punishment of [5] Sin, which is Misery and Death.","Agh son ooilley yn Raaue shoh, ren ad, trooid Miolaghey yn Drogh-spyrryd, Saraghyn Yee y vrishey; as liorish shen y yannoo, cha ren ad ny lomarcan coayll dy chooilley Chairys gys y Gialdyn jeh Bea as Maynrys dy bragh farraghtyn, agh ren ad myrgeddin tuittym fo lheid y Deillid ayns nyn Dushtey, fo lheid y Vee-reiltys ayns nyn Aigney as nyn Yeearreeyn, as ta ooilley nyn Sluight gennaghtyn gys nyn Drimshey; [5] as as haink ad dy ve fo Reill as Kerraghey Peccah, quoid ta Treihys as Baase."
"Concerning the Nature and Greatness of this Sin, we are to judge of it by the Greatness of the Punishment inflicted upon them and their Posterity: —For God, being infinitely Just and Holy, could not inflict a Punishment greater than their Sin deserved.","Mychione Dooghys as Mooadys y Pheccah shoh, shegin dooin briwnys, liorish Mooadys y Cherraghey hie er cur orroo hene as nyn Sheeloghe:—Son cha voddagh Jee, ta erskyn earroo Cairal as Casherick, Kerraghey s’trimmey y chur orroo na va nyn Beccah er hoilchin."
,
"Now this was the Occasion of that universal Corruption and Wickedness, which you see and hear of in the World, and which you cannot but, in some Measure, feel in your own Nature: For, as the Scripture informs us, Gen. v. 3. Adam begat his Children in his own Likeness; that is, with such a depraved Nature as his was then become.","Nish shoh va Oyr as Bun ooilley yn Olk as y Vee-chraueeaght shen fey-ny-cruinney, t’ou fakin as clashtyn jeh ayns y Theihll, as sshoh cha vod oo agh gennaghtyn, ayns Ayrn, ayns dty Ghooghys hene: Son myr ta Goo Yee ginsh dooin ayns Lioar Genesis v. 3. Hooar Adam e Chloan ayns e Chaslys hene; ta shen, lesh lheid y Dooghys peccoil as v’eh hene nish ayn."
"And now consider into what a sad Condition these unhappy Offenders had brought themselves, and remember that this is your own Condition, and the Condition of all their Posterity.","As nish smooinee uss dy dowin er, cre’n Stayd hrimshagh va ny Peccee mee-vaynrey shoh er hayrn ad hene ayn, as cooinee dy nee shoh dty Stayd hene, as Stayd ooilley nyn Sheeloghe."
"The Law of Nature and Reason was still in Force, and could not possibly, be dispensed with.—At the same Time they found by sad Experience, That, as St. Paul describes the fallen State of Man, there was [6] a Law in their Members warring against the Law of their Mind; so that the Good which they would, they did not; but the Evil that they would not, that they did, Rom. vii.","Va Leigh Dooghys as Resoon foast ayns slane Bree, as cha voddagh eh er aght erbee ve currit dy lhiattee.—Ec y Traa cheddin dennee ad liorish Prowal hrimshagh, myr ta’n Noo Paul cur Coontey jeh [6] Stayd Dooinney ayns Peccah, Dy row Leigh ayns ny Oltyn oc caggey noi Leigh nyn Aigney; myr shen yn Vie bailliu, shen cha ren ad; agh yn Olk nagh bailliu, shen ren ad, Rom. vii."
"There could not sure be a Condition more deplorable than this;—To live only to contract evil Habits; and by doing so,—To increase their Guilt,—To displease their Creator,—and, To leave an Offspring as miserable as themselves.","Son shickvrys cha voddagh Stayd s’trimshee na shoh y ve:—’Sy Vea shoh ynrycan dy gheddyn drogh Oashyn; as lioroo shen,—Dy vishaghey nyn Beecah,—Dy chur Jymmoose er nyn Ver-croo,—as, Dy aagail sluight nyn yei cha treih roo hene."
"This therefore gave Occasion to God to manifest another of his most glorious Perfections, that is, his infinite Goodness and Mercy.","Shoh er-y-fa shen hug Oyr da Jee dy hoilshaghey da’n Theihll Ayrn elley jeh e Ghooghys smoo gloyroil, ta shen, e Vieys as e Vyghin erskyn-earroo."
"For God foreseeing this lamentable Condition into which they had fallen by departing from their Obedience, his Goodness had provided such a Remedy, as that neither they, nor any of their Posterity, should, on account of their Fall, be eternally miserable, except through their own Fault.","Son myr honnick Jee ro-laue yn Stayd hreih shoh, ayn v’ad er huittym liorish nyn Mee-viallys, va’n Vieys echey er chiarail lheid y Saase shen dy Haualtys, nagh blhiass edyr daue hene, ny da veg jeh nyn Sheeloghe ve ayns Treihys dy bragh farraghtyn, kyndagh rish yn Peccah ocsyn, agh trooid yn Foill oc hene."
"He, therefore, in Consideration of a Redeemer, one of the Seed of the Woman, who mould make full Satisfaction to the Divine Justice for their Transgression, and who should bruise the Head, or break the Power, of that Serpent, (the [7] Devil who tempted them to Sin;—In Consideration of this promised Seed, God entered into a New Covenant with them, by way of Remedy, for what was past, and could not be undone.","Shen-y-fa er coontey Fer-kionnee, Dooinney jeh sluight y Ven, yinnagh Lhiassaghey slane da Cairys Yee son nyn Beecah, as vrooagh Kione, ny vrishagh Pooar, yn Ard-nieu shen (yn Jouyl) ren ad y violaghey gys Peccah;—Er coontey’n Sluight [7] shoh va giallit, ren Jee Conaant Noa y yannoo roo, myr Saase dy yannoo Lhiassaghey son y Peccah va hannah jeant oc, as nagh voddagh nish v’er ny rassey."
"We have reason to believe, that this New Covenant was more fully explained to Adam, than is set down in this short Account given us by Moses, and as it is more fully explained in the Gospel; and which was to this Purpose:—That on Condition of their sincere Repentance, and sincere Obedience afterwards, they should be restored to the Favour of God: and after Death, to that Life and Happiness, which in their State of Innocence was promised to them without tasting of Death; which Favour they had forfeited by their Disobedience.","Ta Oyr ain dy chredjal, dy row Tushtey smoo er ny choyrt da Adam jeh’n Chonaant Noa shoh, na ta soit sheese ayns y Choontey giare shoh t’er ny choyrt dooin liorish Moses, as myr te ny s’baghtal er ny hoilshaghey ayns y Tushtal; as shen va er yn Aght shoh:—Er Coontey nyn Arrys creeoil, as nyn Miallys firrinagh ny lurg shen, dy beagh ad reesht goit stiagh ayns Foayr rish Jee: as lurg Baase, dy voghe ad yn Vea as y Vaynrys shen, va giallit daue ayns nyn Stayd dy Neu-loghtynys fegooish blashtyn jeh’n Vaase; yn Foayr cheddin v’ad er choayll liorish nyn Mee-viallys."
"And when we consider, that our first Parents, now become Sinners, stood in need of an Atonement, without which, while under the Displeasure of God, their very Lives must be a Burthen; and it being decreed by God, as it afterwards appeared, that without shedding of Blood there was to be no Remission of Sin; i. e. without the Death of the Sinner, or some one in his Stead: We [8] do therefore conclude, that, at this Time, God did appoint Sacrifices, or Sin-offerings, to make an Atonement for the Soul, and to foreshew the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, (which we now commemorate) until he should be offered in behalf of them and all their Posterity.","As tra ta shin goaill gys nyn Gree, dy row nyn gied Ayr as Moir, nish jeant nyn Beccee, feme Lhiassaghey ve jeant er nyn son, n’egooish choud as v’ad fo Jymmoose Yee, beign da eer nyn Mioys hene ve ny Errey daue; as son wheesh as dy row eh sarit liorish Jee, myr ve ny lurg shen er ny hoilshaghey, Fegooish Deayrtey foalley nagh row Leih Peccah edyr dy ve; ta shen, fegooish Baase [8] y Pheccagh, ny Baase Fer ennnagh er e hon: Ta shin er-y-fa shen goaill son shickyrys dy nee, ec y Traa shoh, doardee Jee Ourallyn ny Chebballyn peccah, dy yannoo Lhiassaghey son yn Annym, dy chowraghey yn Oural veagh jeant jeh Yeesey Creest (ta shin nish freayll Cooinaghtyn jeh) derrey veagh eh er ny hebbal ass y lieh ocsyn as ooilley nyn Sheeloghe."
"And this appears from what Follows in the next Chapter of Genesis, where we find Abel, by Faith, (that is, believing and depending upon this Ordinance of God, for the Remission of Sins, until the promised Redeemer should come; we find him) offering a Sacrifice which was acceptable to God, that is, a Sin-offering, which his Brother not doing, was rejected.","As ta shoh er ny akin liorish ny ta scruit ayns y chiarroo Chabdil jeh Lioar Genesis, raad ta shin feddyn Abel liorish Credjue (ta shen dy ghra, credjal as treishteil ayns yn Oardaghey shoh dy Yee, son Leih Peccaghyn, derrey harragh yn Fer-kionnee va giallit; ta shin feddyn eh) chebbal Oural taitnyssagh da Jee, ta shen, Oural-Peccah, son gyn jannoo shoh va e Vraar er ny gheyrey."
"But here take notice and remember, that these Sacrifices could not take away Sin, but only through Obedience to the Ordinance of God, and through Faith in the promised Seed.","Agh ayns shoh gow tastey as cooinee, nagh voddagh ny Ourallyn shoh goaill ersooyl Peccah, agh ynrycan trooid Biallys gys Oardaghey Yee, as trooid Credjue ayns y Sluight va giallit."
"They were indeed very instructive and proper to lead Sinners to Repentance, and Amendment of Life, when they saw, that their Sins could not be forgiven, but by the Death of an innocent Creature, [9] bleeding and dying before their Eyes, to make an Atonement for their Sin.","V’ad dy jarroo Ynsaghey feer chooie dy leeideil Peccee gys Arrys as Lhiassaghey Bea, tra honnick ad, nagh voddagh nyn Beccaghyn v’er nyn leih, agh liorish Baase y Chretoor gyn-loght va’n uill dy lhiggey ass, as [9] goll dy baase kiongoyrt rish nyn Sooillyn, dy yannoo Lhiassaghey son nyn Beccah."
"And as all good Men, before the Coming of Christ, did most religiously keep up the Remembrance of the promised Seed, and obtained the Pardon of their Sins, and Acceptance with God, upon offering Sacrifices through Faith in a Redeemer which was to come;—So all Christians, since the Coming of that Redeemer, are obliged, as they hope for Pardon, and Favour from God, to keep up the Remembrance of God’s great Mercy, in sending us a Redeemer, and of what that Redeemer has done to save us; and this in the Manner which He himself hath ordained.","As myr shen dy chooilley Ghooinney mie, roish my daink Creest, dy feer chrauee freayll seose Cooinaghtyn jeh’n Sluight v’er ny ghialdyn, as dy dooar ad Leih son nyn Beccaghyn, as Soiaghey jeant jeu liorish Jee, liorish chebbal Ourallyn trooid Credjue ayns Fer-kionnee va ry-heet;—Myr shen, neayr as haink y Fer-kionnee cheddin, ta dy chooilley Chreestee kianlt, myr t’ad jerkal rish Pardoon as Foayr veih Jee, dy chummal seose Cooinaghtyn jeh Myghin vooar Yee ayns coyrt hooin Fer-kionnee, as jeh ny ta’n Fer-kionnee shen er n’yannoo dy hauail shin; as shoh er yn aght t’eh hene er n’oardrail."
"Now that you may be more sensible of, and thankful to God for, this his infinite Loving-kindness, and that you may be fully convinced of the Necessity and Blessing of a Redeemer, you ought to know and consider, “that our Saviour and Redeemer came not, until Man had been tried in all Conditions, In a State of Innocence,—Under the Government of his own Reason,—and Under the Law given by Moses:—All which Methods of [10] Providence, thro’ the perverse Will of Man, had been rendered ineffectual for the Amendment of the World Notwithstanding which, such was the Goodness of God, that He sent, after all, his only beloved Son, to take our Nature upon him, and to assure Mankind of the tender Love which he had for his poor Creatures who were ruining themselves, without perceiving the Danger they were in.","Nish dy vod Tushtey share y ve ayd’s jeh, as oo ny s’booisal da Jee son, shoh e Chenjallys ghraihagh erskyn-earroo, as dy vod Credjue, s’troshey y ve ayd jeh nyn Ymmyrch as Bannaght yn Er-kionnee, lhisagh oo toiggal as dy dowin smooinaghtyn, nagh daink nyn Saualtagh as nyn Ver-kionnee, derrey va Dooinney er ny phrowal ayns dy chooilley Stayd-bea,—Ayns Stayd dy Neu-loghtynys,—Fo Reill yn Resoon Echey hene,—As Fo yn Leigh v’er ny Choyrt liorish [10] Moses:—Ooilley ny Saaseyn cheddin jeh Ard-chiarail Yee, trooid Aigney vee-reiltagh Dooinney haink dy ve neu-vreeoil dy lhiassaghey yn Seihll.—Ny-yeih lheid shen va Mieys Yee, lurg ooilley dy dug eh e Vac ynrycan ennoil, dy ghoaill y Dooghys ainyn er, as dy chur Shickyrys da Sheelnaue jeh e Ghraih veiygh da e Chretooryn boghtey, va dy chur naardey ad hene, fegooish Ennaghtyn jeh’n Dangeyr v’ad ayn."
"This was the Promised Seed!—Promised to Adam, as He that should break the Serpent’s Head, or Power of the Devil:—Promised to Abraham, as He in whom all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed:—Promised to the People of Israel, as that Prophet whom they should hear and obey at their Peril:—Lastly, promised to David, as one whose Kingdom should have no End, And indeed it was with this Promise that God supported the Spirits of all that feared him, and were in Fear for themselves, until the Fulness of the Time for his Appearance should come.","Shoh va’n Sluight giallit!—Giallit da Adam, myr Fer yinnagh broo Kione yn Ard-nieu, ny Pooar y Drogh-spyrryd:—Giallit da Abraham, myr Eshyn ayn veagh ooilley Ashoonyn ny Hooirey er nyn mannaghey:—Giallit da Pobble Israel, myr y Phadeyr shen beign daue clashtyn rish as ve biallagh da er Gaue anmey:—Er-jerrey ooilley, giallit da David, myr Eshyn, er e Reeriaght nagh beagh Jerrey erbee, As dy jarroo she lesh y Gialdyn shoh ren Jee cummal seose ny Creeaghyn ocsyn ooilley va goaill aggle roishyn as v’ayns Aggle er nyn son hene, derrey harragh yn slane Traa mygeayrt dasyn dy hoilshaghey eh-hene da’n Theihll."
,
"And now this Promised Redeemer being come, He first shewed by his own Example, [11] recorded in the Gospel, how Men must live, so as to please God.—And the Law of Nature, as well as the Law of Moses, having thro’ Sin been much obscured and perverted, he explained them, and gave us such other Laws and Rules, as were absolutely necessary to mend our Nature,—to restore us to the Image of God,—to keep us from Backsliding, and—to fit us for Heaven and Happiness.","As nish dy vel y Fer-kionnee Giallit er jeet, Hoilshee eh hoshiaght liorish y Sampleyr echey [11] hene, ta scruit ayns y Tushtal, kys lhisagh Deiney gymmyrkey nyn Mea dy ve taitnyssagh da Jee.—As myr va Leigh Dooghys chammah as Leigh Voses, dy mooar er ny gholley as er ny chassey trooid Peccah, hoilshee eshyn y Bun oc, as hug eh dooin lheid ny Leighyn as Saraghyn elley shen, as va slane ymmyrchagh dy lhiassaghey nyn Ghooghys,—dy hyndaa shin reesht gys Caslys Yee,—dy reayll shin veih skirraghtyn, as—dy yannoo shin cooie son Niau as Maynrys."
"And because in the Decrees of God, as was before observed, without shedding of Blood there could be no Remission of Sin; and it being impossible that the Blood or Life of any other Creature, or of any mortal Man, could take away the Guilt and Punishment due to Sin;—our gracious God, both to give to Mankind the greatest Token of his Love, and at the fame time, to shew how great his Hatred to Sin is, by the Greatness of the Punishment it required, He sent his own Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins; that is, to make Satisfaction to his Justice, and to take off the just Displeasure which he had declared against Sinners.","As er-yn-oyr liorish Oardaghyn Yee, myr dooyrt shin roïe, fegooish Deayrtey foalley nagh row Leih Peccah dy ve ayn; as myr ve neu-phossible dy voddagh Fuill ny Bioys Cretoor erbee elley, ny Fuill Dooinney erbee marvaanagh, goaill ersooyl Loght as Kerraghey Peccah;—nyn Yee graysoil, chammah dy chur da Sheelnaue yn Cowrey smoo jeh e Ghraih, as ec y Traa cheddin, dy hoilshaghey cre wheesh as va e Ghwoaie er Peccah, liorish Mooadys yn Cherraghey va soit er, Hug eh e Vac hene dy ve ny Oural-shee son ny Peccaghyn ain; ta shen, dy yannoo Lhiassaghey da e Chairys, as dy veiyghey e Yymmoose cairal v’eh er n’ockley-magh noi Peccee."
,
"And his Son (blessed for [12] ever be his Goodness!) knowing how dreadfully sad the Condition would be of all such, who should live and die under the Displeasure of God, and what unconceivable Happiness they would deprive themselves of; He therefore, moved with Compassion for so great a Calamity, undertook to obtain their Pardon.","As e Vac (bannit dy bragh [12] dy row e Vieys!) toiggal cre cha atchimagh treih veagh y Stayd ocsyn ooilley, yinnagh beaghey as baase y gheddyn fo Jymmoose Yee, as cre’n Vaynrys erskyn Tushtey chaillagh ad liorish; shen-y-fa ayns e Ard-erreeish son lheid y Treihys doogh, ghow eh er dy chosney Pardoon daue."
"In order to this, he cloathed himself with our Flesh, that, as Man, He might suffer what our Sins had deserved, and, as He was the Son of God, he might make a full and suitable Satisfaction to the Divine Justice, offering himself a Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World: And for the Joy of delivering so many Millions of Souls from Misery, he endured the Death of the Cross, and all the Afflictions leading to it, which we find recorded in the Gospel.","Dy chooilleeney shoh, ghow eh er hene yn Eill ainyn, dy voddagh Eh, myr Dooinney, surranse shen va ny Peccaghyn ainyn er hoilchin; as myr v’eh Mac Yee, dy voddagh eh Lhiassaghey slane as cooie y yannoo da’n Chairys Flaunyssagh, chebbal eh hene ny Oural son Peccaghyn y Theihll ooilley: As er Graih yn Voggey dy livrey whilleen milley Annym veih Treihys, duillee eh Baase ny Croshey, as ooilley yn Seaghyn ta bentyn rish, myr ta shin lhaih ayns y Sushtal."
"And by this worthy Sacrifice, all Mankind are restored to the Favour of God, and put into a Way and State of Salvation; God having for his Son’s sake promised to pardon all such as shall repent, and forsake their Sins, and bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance;—As also to give his Holy Spirit to all [13] such as shall sincerely desire him;—And lastly, to make them eternally happy after Death, if during this short State of Trial, which is designed to amend our corrupt and disordered Nature, they endeavoured to observe the Rules which he has given them, and which are absolutely necessary to make them capable of Heaven and Happiness.","As liorish yn Oural ooasle shoh, ta ooilley Sheelnaue reesht goit stiagh ayns Foayr rish Jee, as er nyn goyrt ayns Raad as Stayd dy Haualtys; Myr va Jee er Graih e Vac er n’ghialdyn dy leih dauesyn ooilley ghoys Arrys, as hreigys nyn Beccaghyn, as ymmyrkys magh Mess cooie dy Arrys;—As myrgeddin dy choyrt e Spyrryd [13] Casherick dauesyn ooilsey nee dy creeoil Eshyn y yeearree;—As ec y jerrey, dy chur daue Maynrys dy bragh farraghtyn lurg y Vaase, my she shen ayns y Stayd ghiare shoh dy Phrowal, ta kiarit dy lhiassaghey nyn Ghooghys neu-ghlen as meereiltagh, ren ad y chooid share dy chooilleeney ny Saraghyn t’eh er hoiaghey roue, as ny Saraghyn cheddin ta er dy chooilley Chor ymmyrchagh dy yannoo ad cooie son Niau as Maynrys."

,
"He might in strict Justice have required Men to have lived up to the Law of Nature and Reason given in the State of Innocence, on pain of being for ever separated from his Presence: But instead of that, he has been graciously pleased to accept of our sincere, tho’ imperfect, Obedience, and of our sincere Repentance, when we have done amiss, and return to our Duty.","Ayns y lhome Chairys oddagh eh v’er harey Deiney dy v’er leeideil nyn Mea corrym rish Leigh nyn Ghooghys as y Resoon va oc ‘sy Stayd dy Onid, fo Briwnys dy ve scarrit veih e Eanish son dy bragh: Agh ayns Ynnyd shen, S’cooidsave lesh dy graysoil dy yannoo Soiaghey jeh nyn Miallys ynrick ga neu-feeu, as jeh nyn Arrys firrinagh, tra ta shin er n’yannoo dy aggairagh, as chyndaa reesht gys nyn Gurrym."

"BLESSED be God for ever for this Instance of his Love to fallen Mankind, in committing the miserable Case of his unhappy Creatures to no less a Person than his own Son!—We are not worthy of all the Mercies which thou hast shewed thy Servants—Grant, O God, that this wonderful Love may not be lost upon me: But that, knowing my sad Condition by Nature, I may be truly convinced of the Necessity and Blessing of a Redeemer; and that I may, with a Heart full of Gratitude, join with thy Church in giving our devoutest Thanks to Thee, and in keeping up the Remembrance of what thy blessed Son has done and suffered for us; to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour, Praise, and Thanksgiving, forever and ever.

The End and Institution of the ,Oyr as Oardagh Shibber y Chiarn.
Lord’s Supper.,
"ST. Paul concludes his first Epistle to the Corinthians, with this remarkable Direction; —If any Man [15] love not the Lord Jesus, let him be Anathema Maranatha; that is,—Let him be separated from your Communion, as one under the Displeasure of God, and, without a timely Repentance, in no Possibility of being saved;—Nothing being more grievous in the Sight of God, than for a Sinner to slight the greatest Instance of his Mercy that was ever offered to Man, as well as the only Means of his Salvation.","TA’N Noo Paul cur jerrey er y chied Screeuyn echey gys ny Corinthianee, lesh y Sarey shoh ta feeu nyn Dastey;[15]—My ta My ta Dooinney erbee nagh nhynney lesh y Chiarn Yeesey, lhig da ve Anathema Maranatha; ta shen,—Lhig da ve scarrit veih’n Cheshaght eu, myr Fer fo Jymmoose Yee, as, fegooish Arrys leah nagh vod er Aght erbee ve er ny hauail;—Er-yn-oyr nagh vel Nhee erbee ny s’eajee ayns Shilley Yee, na son Peccagh dy hoiaghey beg jeh’n Cowrey smoo shoh jeh e Vyghin va rieau chebbit da Dooinney, chammah as yn ynrycan Saase jeh’n Taualtys echey."
"To prevent this, and to hinder Sinners from forgetting [which they are but too apt to do] this Token of God’s infinite Love, and to fix the Love of Jesus Christ more surely in our Hearts and Memory, He himself hath taken care, that his Love and Mercy should, throughout all Generations, be remembered: He did therefore ordain this Sacrament as a Memorial of our Redemption, and of his Love for us;—as a Pledge to assure us of it, and as an outward Means and Sign of testifying, as well as increasing, our Love to him.","Dy haghney shoh, as dy lhiettal Peccee (myr t’ad ro aarloo) dy yarrood yn Cowrey shoh jeh Graih erskyn-towse Yee, as dy hoiaghey Graih Yeesey Creest ny shickyree ayns nyn Gree as nyn Gooinaghtyn; T’eh hene er ghoaill Kiarail, dy beagh Cooinaghtyn er ny reayll jeh e Ghraih as e Vyghin, trooid magh dy chooilley Heeloghe: Ren eh er-y-fa shen goardrail y Sacrament shoh myr Imraa jeh nyn Livrey-ys, as jeh e Ghraih dooinyn;—myr Gioal dy hickyraghey shin jeh, as myr Saase as Cowrey baghtal dy hoilshaghey, chammah as dy vishaghey, nyn Ghraih huggey."
"The holy Apostles of Christ, who were present when he first administered this Sacrament, give us the [16] following Account of its End and Institution.","Ta Ostyllyn Casherick Chreest, va kionfenish tra ren eh hoshiaght yn Sacrament casherick shoh y hirveish, cur [16] dooin y Coontey shoh jeh’n Oyr as yn Oardaghey."
"They signify to us in the first Place, that this Sacrament was ordained by Christ the same Night in which he was betrayed, and after they had observed the Passover, which had been ordained to preserve the Memory of their great Deliverance from the Bondage of Egypt, and which did prefigure, and was a Prophecy of, a much greater Deliverance, which Jesus Christ was to be the Author of, not only for them, but for all Mankind:—And which Prophecy was surprizingly fulfilled by that People, without knowing what they were a-doing, when they crucified Jesus Christ, the true Paschal Lamb, the very same Month, the very same Day of the Month, and the very same Hour of the Day, that the Paschal Lamb was first ordained to be sacrificed.","T’ad soilshaghey dooin ayns y chied Ynnyd, dy row yn Sacrament shoh oardit liorish Creest yn Oie cheddin ayn v’eh er ny vrah, as lurg daue v’er n’ee yn Eayn Caisht, va sarit dy reayll seose Cooinaghtyn jeh nyn Livrey-ys mooar veih Bondiaght Egypt, as ren cowraghey ro-laue, as va ny Adeyrys jeh, Livrey-ys foddey smoo, va Yeesey Creest dy chosney, cha nee ynrycan dauesyn, agh da ooilley Sheelnaue:—As va’n Phadeyrys shen ayns Aght yindyssagh cooilleenit liorish yn Pobble cheddin, gyn Toiggal oc cre v’ad dy yannoo, tra ren ad Yeesey Creest y chrossey, yn Eayn Caisht firrinagh, ayns yn eer Vee cheddin, er yn eer Laa cheddin jeh’n Vee, as ayns yn eer Oor cheddin jeh’n Laa, va’n Eayn Caisht hoshiaght oardit dy v’er ny ouralley."

"Now after the Paschal Supper, as the Apostles relate it,—Jesus Christ took Bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying, Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you: This do in Remembrance of Me. He took also the Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all [17] of this, for This is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is shed for you, and for many, for the Remission of Sins: This do, as oft as ye shall drink it, in Remembrance of Me; for as oft as ye shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord’s Death till he come.","Nish lurg Shibber yn Eayn Caisht, myr ta ny Ostyllyn cur Coontey jeh,—Ghow Yeesey Arran, as vannee eh eh, as vrish eh eh, as hug eh eh da e Ostyllyn, gra, Gow-jee, ee-jee, Shoh my Chorp’s, t’er ny choyrt er nyn son eu: Jean-jee shoh ayns Cooinaghtyn jeem’s.—Ghow eh myrgeddin y Cappan, as hug eh Booise, as chur eh daue eh, gra, [17] Iu-jee ooilley jeh shoh, son she Shoh my Uill’s jeh’n Chonaant Noa, t’er ny gheayrtey er nyn son euish, as er son ymmodee, son Leih Peccaghyn: Shoh jean-jee, cha mennick as iu-ys shiu eh, ayns Cooinaghtyn Jeem’s; son cha mennick as eeys shiu yn Arran shoh, as iuys shiu yn Cappan shoh, ta shiu soilshaghey magh Baase y Chiarn derrey hig eh."
"In Obedience therefore to this Command of Jesus Christ, who has delivered us from a much greater Bondage than that of Egypt—The Christian Church keeps up the Memory of his Love, his Sacrifice, and his Sufferings and Death, after this solemn Manner: ","Shen-y-fa ayns Biallys da’n Sarey shoh jeh Yeesey Creest, t’er livrey shinyn veih Bondiaght foddey smoo na Bondiaght Egypt.—Ta’n Agglish Chreestee cummal seose Cooinaghtyn jeh e Ghraih, jeh e Oural, as jeh e Hurranse as e Vaase, er yn Aght arrymagh shoh:"
"First, as an Acknowledgement that our Lives, and all that we eat or drink to preserve them, are owing to the Bounty of God, we present upon his Table, by the Hands of his own Minister, a Portion of his Creatures, the best we have for the Support and Comfort of our natural Life, namely, Bread and Wine.—After this the Bread and Wine are consecrated, the Bread is broken, and the Wine poured out, to represent the Death of Christ whose Body was broken, and whose Blood was shed for us. [18]","Hoshiaght, myr Cowrey dy vel nyn Mioys, as ooilley ny ta shin dy ee as dy iu dy reayll shin bio, cheet veih Feoiltys Yee, ta shin soiaghey magh er y Voayrd echey, lesh Laueyn e Hirveishagh hene, Ayrn jeh e Chretooryn, yn chooid share t’ain dy niartaghey as dy gherjaghey nyn Mioys dooghyssagh, ta shen dy ghra, Arran as Feeyn.—Ny lurg shoh ta’n Arran as y Feeyn er nyn gasherickey, ta’n Arran er ny vrishey, as ta’n Feeyn er ny gheayrtey magh, dy chowraghey Baase Chreest, e Chorp v’er ny vrishey, as e Uill v’er ny gheayrtey er nyn son. [18]"
"Then the Minister of GOD, as the Steward of Christ’s Houshold, applies these Blessings to every Person who receives this Sacrament, in this devout Prayer:—The Body and Blood of Christ, which were given and shed for Thee, preserve thy Body and Soul unto everlasting Life.","Eisht ta Shirveishagh Yee, myr Stiurt harrish Lught-thie Chreest shirveish ny Bannaghtyn shoh er dy chooilley Phersoon ta goaill y Sacrament cheddin, ayns y Phadjer chrauee shoh:—Corp as Fuill nyn Jiarn Creest hie er coyrt as er deayrtey er dty hon’s, dy vreill ad dty Chorp as dty Annym gys y Vea dy bragh farraghtyn."
,
"And we may be assured of it, that this Sacrament will be to every worthy Communicant, what the Tree of Life would have been unto Adam and Eve in Paradise: And that as they, had they continued obedient, would have been in no Danger of temporal Death; even so we, while we feed on this Bread now endued with a Life-giving Spirit, and live as we ought to do, are in no Danger of Death eternal.","As foddee mayd ve shickyr jeh, dy bee yn Sacrament shoh da dy chooilley unnane ta goaill eh dy feeu, jeh’n Foays cheddin veagh Billey yn Vea er phrowal da Adam as Aue ayns Pargeiys: As myr nagh beagh adsyn, dy beagh ad er hannaghtyn biallagh, er ve ayns Gaue erbee Baaish ‘sy Theihll shoh; eer myr shen, choud as ta shinyn beaghey er yn Arran shoh nish coamrit lesh Spyrryd bioghee, as gymmyrkey nyn Mea myr lhisagh shin, cha vel shin ayns Gaue erbee jeh’n Baase dy bragh farraghtyn:"
,
"These being Pledges to assure us, that as certainly as Bread and Wine do nourish our Bodies, so do these seal to us all the Benefits which Jesus Christ hath purchased for us, by his Sacrifice and Death.","Son t’ad shoh Gialteenyn dy chur Shickyrys dooin, cha firrinagh as ta Arran as Feeyn beaghey nyn Gallinyn, cha firrinagh cheddin dy vel ad shoh sealal dooin ooilley ny Bannaghtyn ta Yeesey Creest er chosney dooin, liorish e Oural as e Vaase."
,
"And when any Christian does wilfully, and for want of Faith, deprive himself of [19] this this Spiritual Food, he falls, as our first Parents did, into a State purely natural, and destitute of the Means of Grace and Salvation.","As tra ta Creestee erbee jeh e Yioin, as son laccal Credjue, giarey magh eh hene veih’n [19] Beaghey Spyrrydoil shoh, t’eh tuittym, myr ren nyn gied Ayr as Moir, ayns Stayd eer dooghyssagh, as fegooish ny Saaseyn dy Ghrayse as dy Haualtys."
,
,
"For the Happiness of the World, and of every Soul in it, depends upon the Sacrifice of Christ, of which we are bound to keep up the Remembrance after this solemn Manner:","Son ta Maynrys y Theihll, as dy chooilley Annym t’ayn, lhie er Oural Chreest, jeh ta shin kianlt dy reayll seose Cooinaghtyn er yn Aght casherick shoh."
"That whenever we pray for any Favour or Blessing we may remember to do it in his Name:—That whenever we are so unhappy as to have done any Thing which may displease God, we may remember to pray to be forgiven for Christ’s sake.","Cre-erbee yn Traa ta shin guee son Foayr ny Bannaght erbee, dy vod mayd cooinaghtyn dy yannoo eh ‘syn Ennym echeysyn:—Cre-erbee yn Traa ta shin cha mee-vaynrey as dy ve er n’yannoo Red erbee oddys Jymmoose y chur er Jee, dy vod mayd cooinaghtyn dy ghuee son Leih er y hon er Graih Chreest."
"For God grants whatever we ask, and which he sees to be for our Good, when we ask in Faith, that is, in his Son’s Name; and therefore the Church concludes all her Prayers in these most prevailing Words,—For Jesus Christ’s Sake.","Son ta Jee coyrt cre-erbee ta shin geearree, as shen t’eh fakin dy ve son nyn Voays, tra ta shin geearree ayns Credjue, ta shen, ayns Ennym e Vac; as shen-y-fa ta’n Agglish cur Jerrey er ooilley ny Padjeryn eck ayns ny Goan smoo breeoil shoh,—Er Graih Yeesey Chreest."
"In one Word, we do by this Sacrament keep up a continual Correspondence with our Lord in Heaven, and hold Communion with him, and with all the Members of his Body, which receive [20] Nourishment and Growth from Him, as the Branches from the Tree, in which they are grafted, and from which when they are separated, they can bear no Fruit, and are only fit to be burned.","Ayns un Ockle, liorish y Sacrament shoh ta shin freayll seose Ainjys chinjagh rish nyn Jiarn t’ayns Niau, as cummal Sheshaght Spyrrydoil rishyn as rish ooilley Oltyn[1] e Chorp, ta geddyn Ooraghey as [20] Bishaghey veihsyn, myr ta ny Banglaneyn veih’n Villey, er t’ad gaase, as tra t’ad scarrit voish, cha vod ad veg y Vess y ymmyrkey, chamoo t’ad son Ymmyd erbee agh son yn Aile."
,
"And as every Christian is obliged, at the Peril of his Soul, to observe it: So the Duty must be such, as every one, even the most unlearned, may understand, if it is not his own Fault.","As myr ta dy chooilley Chreestee, er Gaue Anmey, kianlt dy ghoaill yn Chreestiaght shoh: Myr shen shegin da’n Currym ve lheid, as oddys dy chooilley unnane toiggal, eer eshyn smoo ta gyn Ynsghey lioaragh, mannagh bee eh yn Oill echey hene."
"And so indeed it is: For as an Israelite, Levit. i. 4. under the Law, being obliged to lay his Hand upon the Head of his Sacrifice, confessing his Sins in laying them as it were, upon that Creature,—as he did easily understand, that this was to shew him, that Death was the due Reward of Sin; that this ought to humble him before God, and to give him the greatest Abhorrence of Sin, which could not be pardoned but by the Loss of the Life of an innocent Creature:","As myr shen dy jarroo te: Son myr va Israelite Lev. i. 4. fo yn Leigh, kianlt dy lhie e Laue er Kione yn Oural, goaill rish e Pheccaghyn as coyrt ad, myr dy beagh eh, er y Chretoor shen, myr v’eh dy aashagh toiggal, dy row shoh dy hoilshaghey da, dy nee Baase va Leagh cairal Peccah; dy lhisagh shoh y injillaghey eh fenish Jee, as coyrt da yn Dwoaie smoo oddagh y ve noi Peccah, nagh voddagh ve er ny leih, agh liorish Coayl Bioys Cretoor gyn-loght:"
"As this was plain to the meanest Israelite, even so the most unlearned Christian, when he considers, that our Lord Jesus Christ became a Sacrifice for us, and that on Him all our Sins were laid,[21]—on him who knew no Sin;—he will easily understand how sad our Condition was, which required such a Sacrifice:—That this therefore ought to humble us,—To lead us to Repentance,—To make us fearful of offending God,—And to abhor those Sins which cost Jesus Christ his Life, before God could be prevailed with to pardon them.","Myr va shoh dy aashagh toiggit liorish yn Israelite s’fardalee, dy jarroo myr shen yn Creestee sloo ynsit, tra t’eh toiggal, dy daink nyn Jiarn Yeesey Creest dy ve ny Oural er nyn son, as dy ren Eshyn [21] gymmyrkey slane Errey nyn Beccaghyn,—eshyn nagh bione da Peccah;—nee eh dy aashagh toiggal cre cha trimshagh as va Stayd Sheelnaue, va feme lheid yn Oural:—Dy lhisagh shoh er-y-fa shen shin y injillaghey,—shin y leeideil gys Arrys,—shin y yannoo agglagh dy chur Corree er Jee,—As dy chur Dwoaie da ny Peccaghyn shen chost e Vioys da Yeesey Creest, roish my voddagh Jee v’er ny veiyghey dy leih ad."
"He will also easily understand, that the Love of Christ, and the Remembrance of his Death, ought to be very dear to us; and that the oftener we remember it, in the Manner he ordained, the more Graces we shall receive from God,—The firmer will be our Faith, the surer our Pardon, and the more comfortable our Hopes of meeting Him, not as an Enemy, but as a Friend, at whose Table we have been so often entertained.","Nee eh myrgeddin dy aashagh toiggal, dy lhisagh Graih Chreest, as Cooinaghtyn jeh e Vaase, ve feer deyr dooin; as myr s’menkey nee mayd cooin aghtyn er, ‘syn Aght t’eh hene er n’oardaghey, shen myr smoo dy Ghrayseyn yiow mayd veih Jee,—Myr s’niartal vees nyn Gredjue, myr shickyree vees nyn Bardoon, as myr s’gerjoilee vees nyn Dreishteil dy gholl ny whail, cha nee myr Noid, agh myr Carrey, as ec e Voayrd ta shin cha mennick er ve nyn Ghoaldee."

"And now, if you have considered what you have read with any Degree of Attention, you will pause a-while,—until you have expressed your Gratitude for this Mercy, after some such Manner as this following.","As nish, my t’ou er ghoaill gys dty Chree shen ny t’ou er lhaih, lesh Ayrn erbee dy Chiarail, nee oo smooinaghtyn ort hene son tammylt,—derrey t’ou er n’ockley magh dty Vooise son y Vyghin cheddin, ayns lheid ny Goan shoh."

"AS the above Account of this holy Ordinance is easy to be understood, even by the most unlearned Christian; so the Preparation required is such, as will neither puzzle the Understanding, nor burden the Memory, nor take up too much of the Time of those that are engaged in the most necessary Employments of Life.","MYR ta’n Coontey shoh jeh’n Oardaghey casherick shen aashagh dy ve toiggit, dy jarroo liorish y Chreestee sloo dy Ynsaghey; myr shen ta’n Aarlaghey ymmyrchagh er y hon lheid, as nagh jean goll erskyn y Tushtey, ny laadey yn Chooinaghtyn, ny goaill seose rouyr jeh’n Traa ocsyn smoo ta geiyrt er Aghtyn-beaghee ymmyrchagh y Vea shoh."
"The Church had regard to all her Members, when she gave this short and plain Direction to such as prepare to go to the Lord’s Supper.","Va Sooill ec yn Agglish gys ooilley e Holtyn, tra hug ee yn Choyrle ghiare as aashagh shoh dauesyn ta geddyn aarloo dy gholl gys Shibber y Chiarn."
"That they examine themselves,","Dy jean ad ad-hene y eysht,"
Whether they repent them truly of their former Sins?,Vel ad goaill Arrys firrinagh son nyn Beccaghyn t’ad hannah er n’yannoo?

Whether they be in Charity with all Men?,Vel ad ayns Giastyllys rish dy chooilley Ghooinney?
"Now, forasmuch as all Christians, who are capable of examining themselves and their own Consciences, are bound, as they hope for Salvation through Christ, to go to this Sacrament: And because young People are often at a Loss how to examine themselves upon these several Heads: Here follow a few plain Directions, which they that can read, should read with Care; and they that cannot, if they have a true Concern for themselves, will find some good Christian, who will be glad to read it to them, and do thereby a Work which must be well-pleasing to God.","Nish, son wheesh as dy vel dy chooilley Chreestee, oddys feysht ad hene as nyn Gooinsheanseyn, kianlt dy gholl gys y Sacrament shoh, myr t’ad jerkal rish Saualtys trooid Creest: As son wheesh as dy vel Sleih aegey dy mennick mee-hushtagh kys dy gholl mysh feysht ad hene er dagh Banglane jeu shoh:—Yiow ad ny-yeï shoh Coyrle ghiare aashagh, lhisagh adsyn oddys lhaih y lhaih dy kiaralagh; as adsyn nagh vod lhaih, my ta scansh firrinagh oc jeu hene, yiow ad Creestee coair ennagh, ghoys Boggey dy lhaih eh daue, as liorish shen jannoo obbyr feer vooisal da Jee."
,
"The First Head on which you are to examine yourself, is concerning your Repentance.","Yn Chied Vanglane t’ou dy eysht oo hene er, te mychione yn Arrys ayd."
"BY what you have already heard concerning the Fall of Man, you understand how all Men became subject and prone to Sin; and you cannot but feel it to be so by sad Experience. We are assured also, and this by the Spirit of God, that without a sincere [25] Repentance no Man must hope to be saved.","LIORISH ny t’ou hannah er chlashtyn mychione Dooinney ve er duittym ayns Peccah, t’ou toiggal kys haink dy chooilley Ghooinney fo Reill Peccah, as lhiant huggey; as nagh vod oo agh gennaghtyn dy nee shen myr te liorish Prowal trimshagh. Ta [25] Shickyrys ain myrgeddin, as shoh liorish Spyrryd Yee, fegooish Arrys firrinagh nagh nhegin da Dooinney erbee jerkal dy ve er ny hauail."
"Now by Repentance you are to understand a Man’s condemning himself, for having done any thing displeasing to God;—either such Things as God has forbidden, to keep us from ruining ourselves, or by omitting such Duties as he has commanded, in order to fit us for Happiness when we die.","Nish liorish Arrys t’ou dy hoiggal, Dooinney ta deyrey eh hene son dy vel eh er n’yannoo Nhee erbee noi Aigney Yee;—edyr lheid as ta Jee er lhiettal, dy reayll shin veih shin hene y chur naardey, ny lhiggey shaghey ny Curmyn shen t’eh er harey, dy yannoo shin cooie son Maynrys tra yiow mayd Baase."
"So that if either the Fear of God’s Displeasure, or a Love of Him, who has been so good to you, will weigh with you, you will most heartily condemn yourself for every thing you have done contrary to his Will and Command.","Myr shen my t’ou jannoo Soiaghey erbee jeh Aggle roish Jymmoose Yee, ny Graih dasyn t’er ve cha mie rhyt, nee oo dy arryltagh oo hene y gheyrey son dy chooilley Nhee t’ou er n’yanooo noi e Aigney as e Harey."
"You will also beg him most earnestly to forgive you what is past, and you will promise and resolve, through his Grace and Help, not wilfully to offend Him again.","Nee oo myrgeddn dy feer jeean guee er dy leih dhyt ny t’er n’gholl shaghey, as giallee oo as kiaree oo, trooid e Ghrayse as e Chooney, nagh jean oo jeh dty Yioin Jymmoose y chur er reesht."
"And lastly, you will not forget to pray for his Grace every Day of your Life, without which your best Resolutions will come to nothing.","As lurg ooilley, cha jarrood oo dy ghoaill Padjer son e Ghrayse dy chooilley Laa jeh dty Vea, n’egooish hed ny Gialdynyn share ayd naardey."
"This is that Repentance, concerning which you are required to examine yourself, before you go to the Lord’s Supper. [26]","Shoh yn Arrys shen, mychione t’ou sarit dy eysht oo hene, roish my hed oo gys Shibber y Chiarn, [26]"

"If this hath been your Case, resolve to break off all these, and all such-like evil Ways, which are displeasing to God; condemn yourself for having so desperately broke the Commands of one who can destroy both Body and Soul in Hell. Consider the Vows that are [27] upon you,—and despise not the Goodness and Forbearance of God, which is designed to lead you to Repentance.

"If you ask when you are to Begin this necessary Work, (if it is not already begun) the Answer is short:—The very Moment you ask the Question;—and this, because, if you find an Unwillingness in yourself to set about it now, that Unwillingness will every Day increase: Very probably you will never repent, unless God by his Judgements, or by the Sight of Death, shews you your fad Error, when it may be too late to be of any real Use to you.","My enys oo cre’n Traa t’ou dy yannoo Toshiaght er yn Obbyr ymmyrchagh shoh (mannagh vel Toshiaght hannah jeant er) ta’n Ansoor giare;—’Syn eer Shallid shoh t’ou fenaght y Question;—as shen, er-yn-oyr, my t’ou gennaghtyn Neu-arryltys aynyd hene dy gholl mygeayrt-y-mysh ec y Traa t’ayn, dy jean yn Neu-arryltys shen bishaghey dy chooilley Laa: Feer laik nagh gow dy bragh Arrys, mannagh jean Jee liorish e Vriwnyssyn, ny liorish shilley jeh’n Vaase, jeeaghyn dty Haghrynys trcih dhyt, tra oddys eh ve ro-anmagh dy ve jeh Foays firrinagh erbee."

"And as he delivered the People of Israel from Bondage, not that they might do what was right in their own Eyes, but that, becoming an holy Nation, they might be an Honour to their Deliverer,—Deut. xix. 5. Even so Christ hath redeemed us from the Bondage of Sin and Satan, that he might redeem us from this present evil World, and purify unto himself a People zealous of good Works.","As myr ren eh Pobble Israel y livrey veih Bondiaght, cha nee dy row ad dy yannoo shen va cairal ayns ny Sooillyn oc hene, agh, erreish daue v’er jeet dy ve Ashoon casherick, dy voddagh ad ve son Ard-ghloyr Dasyn ren ad y livrey.—Deut. xix. 5.—Dy jarroo myr shen ta Creest er eaysley shinyn veih Bondiaght Peccah as Noid ny Hanmey, dy livrey shin veih’n Seihll vee-chrauee shoh, as dy chasherickey da hene Pobble jeean ayns Obbraghyn mie."

"These Duties I will endeavour to perform, as a Proof of the Love and Reverence I bear to God, who is so good as to accept of my Repentance, and a sincere, tho’ imperfect Obedience.","Ny Curmyn shoh neem’s streeu dy chooilleeney, myr Prowal jeh’n Ghraih, as jeh’n Arrym ta mee cur da Jee, eh ta cha mie as dy yannoo Soiaghey jeh my Arrys, as jeh my Viallys giare agh ynrick."
"And if through Weakness, Temptation, or sudden Surprize, I shall be so unhappy as to forget any of these Resolutions, [37] and fall into Sin, I will, as soon as I perceive it, beg God’s Pardon, and be more careful for the Time to come.","As my haghyrys dou trooid Annooinid, trooid Miolaghey, ny Doal-taittym, ve cha mee-vaynrey as dy yarrood veg jeh [37] ny ny Gialdynyn mie shoh, as dy huittym ayns Peccah, cha leah’s vees Toiggal aym jeh nee’m Leih y hirrey er Jee, as bee’m ny s’kiaralee son y Traa ta ry heet."
"Now; if your Conscience can witness for you, that you piously purpose to live after this Manner, you may safely go to the Lord’s Table, and the Blessing of God will go along with you.","Nish, my oddys dty Chooinsheanse hene Feanish y ymmyrkey lhiat, dy vel oo dy crauee kiarail dy veaghey er yn Aght shoh, foddee oo dy sauchey goll gys Boayrd y Chiarn, as hed Bannaght Yee mayrt."

"The next Thing you are to enquire into is, whether you have A lively Faith in God’s Mercy thro’ Christ.","Yn nah red t’ou dy vriaght ayn ta, Vel Credjue bioal ayd ayns Myghin Yee trooid Creest."

"God so loved the World, that he spared not his own Son, (saith the Apostle) but gave him up for us all,—Rom. viii. 32.—Can there be a greater, a surer, Pledge of the Love of God for his poor Creatures?—He made him to be Sin (that is, a Sin-offering):—He delivered him to Death in our stead:—Can we after this doubt of, or distrust, the Mercy of God?","Hug Jee lheid y Ghraih da’n Theihll, nagh haghyn eh e Vac hene (ta’n Ostyl gra) agh livrey eh seose eh er ny son ain ooilley, Rom. viii. 32.—Vod Gioal smoo, Gioal shickyree y ve jeh Graih Yee da e Chretooryn boghtey?—Ren eh eh y yannoo ny Pheccah (ta shen, ny Oural son Peccah):—Livrey eh eh gys Baase ayns yn ynnyd ainyn:—Vod mayd lurg shoh dooyteil jeh, ny Mee-hreishteil y yannoo er Myghin Yee?"
"Observe the Method St. Paul takes to confirm our Faith, by giving us the strongest Proofs of our Acceptance with God.—God, saith he, commended his Love to us, in that, while we were Enemies, we were reconciled to Him, by the Death of his Son.—Much more, being [40] reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life,—Rom. v. 10.—What may we not, after this, hope for from God?","Gow Tastey jeh’n Aght ta’n Noo Paul goaill dy niartaghey nyn Gredjue, liorish coyrt dooin ny Prowallyn s’troshey dy vel Soiaghey er ny yannoo j’in liorish Jee.—Ta Jee, as eshyn er hoilshaghey magh e Ghraih hooinyn, son choud as va shin ayns Stayd dy Noidys, my va shin coardit rish Jee, liorish [40] Baase e Vac.—Foddey smoo, myr ta shin nijsh goit stiagh gys Shee, vees mayd er nyn sauail liorish e Vioys, Rom. v. 10.

"In short, Jesus Christ has redeemed us from the Curse of the Law.—Thro’ him we have Peace with God.—Rom. v. 1.—This is the only Foundation of our Faith, our Hope, and Confidence.—He is our Sacrifice, our Mediator, our Advocate; the Knowledge of which ought to remove all Occasions of Despair and Fear, from the Displeasure of God.","Ayns Focklyn giarey, Ta Yeesey Creest er chionnaghey shin reesht veih Mollaght y [2]Leigh.—Ny hrooidsyn ta Shee ain rish Jee, Rom. v. 1.

"Indeed, if we should attempt to go to God, without an Interest in Christ, we could hope for nothing but to be rejected; but when we go to him, as redeemed by his own Son,—and represent to him, as we do in this Holy Sacrament, what He has done and suffered for us, we approach Him as intirely reconciled to us.","Dy jarroo, dy goghe shin orrin dy gholl gys Jee, fegooish Cairys y ve ain ayns Creest, cha voddagh shin treishteil son monney, agh dy v’er ny yiooldey voish; agh tra ta shin goll huggey, myr livreit liorish e Vac hene,—as soilshaghey roish, myr ta shin jannoo ayns y Sacrament shoh, cre T’eh er n’yannoo as er hurranse er nyn son, ta shin tayrn er-gerrey da myr dy slane coardit rooin."
"But then you must remember, that he gave himself for us, and hath redeemed us from the Power of the Devil, for this End, that he may purify unto himself a People consecrated to his Service.—Consecrate therefore yourself [41] to Jesus Christ, and with faithful Abraham stagger not at the Promises of God: but go to this Sacrament with a full Assurance of Faith, that God will pardon your Sins, and give you all the Graces you shall stand in need of.—Only remember, that this Faith it self is the Gift of God, and must be prayed for, for Christ’s Sake; which you may do after this manner:","Agh eisht shegin cooinaghtyn, dy dug eh eh-hene er nyn son, as dy vel eh er chosney shin veih Pooar y Drogh-spyrryd, son yn Oyr shoh, dy chasherickey da hene Pobble aggindagh gys e Hirveish.—Shen-y-fa jean oo hene y chasherickey gys [41] Yeesey Creest, as marish Abraham slane credjuagh ny jean Mee-hreishteil er Gialdynyn Yee; agh immee gys y Sacrament shoh lesh slane Shickyrys dy Chredjue, dy jean Jee dty Pheccaghyn y leih, as dy der eh dhyt dy chooilley Ghrayse t’ou ayns feme jeh.—Agh cooinee dy nee yn Credjue shoh hene Gioot Yee, as shegin Padjer ve jeant er y hon, er Graih Chreest; shen oddys oo y yannoo er yn Aght shoh:"

"Consider that he was the Son of God, that had done no Wrong, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; notwithstanding this, being to answer for Sinners, He was treated and punished as a Sinner deserves to be:—He was despised!—[43]Set at naught!—Persecuted and rejected by his own People, whom he came to redeem!","Smooinee myrgeddin dy nee Mac Yee v’eh, nagh row er n’yannoo veg yn Aggair, ny chamoo va loght er ny gheddyn ayns e Veeal; ny-yeih, myr v’eh dy reggyrt son Peccee, v’eh deyrit as kerrit, myr ta Kimmagh toilchin:—V’eh oltooanit!—[43]Soit beg jeh!—Tranlaasit as jiooldit rish liorish e Phobble hene, haink eh dy livrey!

"Consider the Reason of all this.—It was not only to satisfy the Justice of God for the Sins of Men, and procure their Pardon upon their Repentance and future Obedience; but also to shew Mankind, what Treatment Sin and Sinners, who have rebelled against their Maker, do deserve;—And teach us when God orders or permits us Sinners to undergo such Indignities and Afflictions, in this our State of Trial, that we ought to take our Cross patiently, as our Redeemer did; and be content, and even pleased, to fulfil the Will of God, in following his Example in his Sufferings in this Life, that we may be partakers of his Glory in the next.","Gow Tastey jeh’n Oyr va son shoh ooilley.—Cha row eh ny lomarcan dy yannoo Cooilleen da Cairys Yee son Peccaghyn Deiney, as dy gheddyn Pardoon daue er nyn Arrys as nyn Miallys son y Traa va ry heet; agh myrgeddin dy hoilshaghey da Sheelnaue, cre’n Kerraghey va Peccah as Peccee dy hoilchin, v’er n’irree-magh noi nyn Ver-croo;—As dy ynsaghey dooin tra ta Jee goardrail ny surranse dooinyn Peccee dy huittym fo lheid ny Scammyltyn naareydagh, as Seaghyn, ayns shoh nyn Stayd dy Phrowal; dy lhisagh shin nyn Grosh y ymmyrkey dy surransagh, myr ren nyn Ver-kionnee; as ve booiagh, as dy jarroo boggey y ghoaill, dy chooilleeney Aigney Yee, ayns geiyrt er y Sampleyr echey ayns e Hurranse ‘sy Vea shoh, dy vod mayd ve goaill Ayrn jeh e [44] Ghloyr ayns y Vea ta ry heet."

"In the next Place, consider the Blessings which Jesus Christ hath by his Death obtained for us.—He hath delivered us from the great Power which the Devil had over Mankind, by procuring us Grace to resist and overcome him.—He hath prevailed with God—To overlook the Untowardess of our Nature; To pardon our greatest Offences upon our true Repentance:—And being by his Death reconciled to God, we have, for his sake, free Liberty to apply to him, as Children to a Father, for what we stand in need of.","Ayns y nah Ynnyd, Gow gys dty Chree ny Bannaghtyn ta Yeesey Creest, liorish e Vaase, er chosney dooin.

"He hath also obtained for us the Assistance of an Almighty Spirit, to enable us to know, and to do, what is necessary to fit us for Heaven and Happiness;—And he has prevailed with God, that these shall be our certain Portion, if we are not wanting to ourselves.—In one Word, Jesus Christ hath entirely freed us from all Fears of what may come hereafter, if it is not purely our own Fault.","T’eh myrgeddin er chosney dooin Cooney Spyrryd Ooilley-niartal, dy niartaghey shin dy hoiggal, as dy yannoo shen, ta ymmyrchagh dy yannoo shin aarloo son Niau as Maynrys;—As t’eh er gheddyn veih Jee, dy bee ad shoh nyn Eiraght shickyr, mannagh bee eh kyndagh rooin henc.—Ayns un Ockle, ta Yeesey Creest dy bollagh er reaghey shin veih dy chooilley Aggle jeh ny oddys cheet ny lurg shoh, mannagh nee ooilley-cooidjagh yn Foill ain hene eh."

"To this End he has ordained, that as all Christians, high and low, rich and poor, shall make up one Body, of which he is the Head:—and one [47] Family of which he is the Master:—So they should all eat at one Table, of one Bread, as a Sign of that Love and Peace, and Friendship, and Readiness to help one another, as occasion shall require, and as Members of the same Body will naturally do.","Er yn Oyr shoh t’eh er oardrail, ‘naght myr shegin da dy chooilley Chreestee, ard as injil, berchagh as boght, jannoo seose un Chorp, jeh t’eshyn yn [47] Kione:—as un Lught-thie, jeh t’eshyn yn Mainshter:—Myr shen lhisagh ad ooilley gee ec yn un Voayrd, jeh’n un Arran, myr Cowrey jeh’n Ghraih as Shee, as Caarjys, as Arryltys shen dy chosney yn derrey yeh lesh y jeh elley, myr vees feme er y hon, as myr ta Oltyn jeh’n un Chorp dy dooie jannoo."

And that you be ready to forgive every Person who may have injured you, as you expect Forgiveness of God, Remembering the dreadful Sentence mentioned in Matth. xviii. Thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all thy Debt: Shouldst not thou have had [48] Companion on thy Fellow-servant, even as I had Pity on thee? And the Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors.",
"And lastly, you are to take care, that you love not in Word only, but in Deed and in Truth, that is, that you do Good, as well as give good Words, and relieve Jesus Christ in his poor Members.","As er-jerrey, t’ou dy ghoaill Kiarail, nagh vel dty Aigney-mie ayns Glare ny lomarcan, agh ayns Jannoo as ayns Firrinys, ta shen dy ghra, dy jean oo Mie, chammah as cur Goan mie, as dy jean oo Feaysley er Yeesey Creest ayns ny Oltyn boghtey echey."
"And believe it for a certain Truth, that a charitable and forgiving Temper is not near so beneficial to any body as to him that hath it; it being more blessed to give than to receive; and to forgive, than to insist upon Satisfaction for Injuries and Wrongs done to us; Acts xx. 35.","As cred eh son Firrinys shickyr, nagh vel Aigney ghiastyllagh as aarloo dy leih faar cha vondeishagh da Persoon erbee, as te dasyn echey te; er-yn-oyr dy vel eh ny s’bannee dy choyrt, na te dy ghoaill; as dy leih, na te dy hassoo er Cooilleen y gheddyn son Aggairyn as drogh Hurnyn ta jeant dooin; Jannoo xx. 35."

"And remember, that the oftener you look into the State of your Soul, in order to go to this Ordinance, the less Trouble you will have to make your Peace with God, when you come to die; and the less Danger you will be in, of falling into a State of Sin and Security, which has been the Ruin of an infinite Number of Souls.","As cooinee, myr s’menkey yeeaghys oo gys Stayd dty Anmey, er-chee goll gys yn Oardaghey shoh, shen myr sloo dy Imnea vees ort dy yannoo dty Hee rish Jee, tra hig oo dy gheddyn Baase; as shen myr sloo dy Ghanjeyr vees oo ayn, dy huittym ayns Stayd dy Pheccah as dy Veerioose, ta er ve Oyr coayl Anmeenyn erskyn-earroo."

"Either you live in some known Sin, or ungodly way of Life, which you cannot resolve to forsake;—Or, you are not willing to renew your Vows, made in Baptism;—Or, which is generally the Case,—You have no real Concern for your Soul; only you delude yourself with some faint Purposes and Hopes, that some time or other you will become a new Man.","Edyr t’ou beaghey ayns Peccah ennagh er-fys dhyt, er-nonney ayns Raad mee-chrauee dy Vea, nagh jean oo goaill ayns Laue dy hreigeil;—Er-nonney, cha vel oo booiagh dty Vreearraghyn Bashtey y yannoo ass y noa;—Er-nonney, myr s’menkey lesh y ve,—Cha vel oo dy firrinagh imneagh son dty Annym; ynrycan dy vel oo molley oo hene lesh Gialdyn as Treishteil faase ennagh, dy jig oo Keayrt ny Keayrt ennagh dy ve dty Ghooinney noa."

You bring an evil Report upon an Ordinance of Christ, as if it were not worth observing:—You harden wicked People in their Infidelity, and Neglect of their Salvation, by calling [52] yourself a Christian, and living like a Heathen, in the Contempt of one of the greatest Means of Salvation: You live in a State in which all your Prayers, whether public or private, whether for yourself or for others, will all be rejected.","‘Sy Traa t’ayn t’ou oolee jeh Peccah ta rouyr casley rish gobbal y Chiarn ren oo y chionnaghey.—T’ou tayrn Scammylt er Oardaghey Chreest, myr nagh beagh eh feeu Geill ‘chur da: T’ou creoghey drogh Leih ayns nyn Mee-chredjue, as nyn Meerioose jeh’n Taualtys oc, liorish [52] genmys oo hene dty Chreestee, as leeideil Bea goll-rish Anchreestee, ayns soiaghey-beg jeh unnane jeh ny Ard-saaseyn dy Haualtys: T’ou beaghey ayns Stayd, ayn vees beg er ny hoiaghey jeh ooilley dty Phadjeryn, edyr ec y Cheeill ny ec y Thie, edyr er dty hon hene,  ny son feallagh elley."
"In short you provoke God every Day more and more to withdraw his Grace.—To leave you to your own corrupt way of Living, till you have filled up the Measure of your Sins, and prepared yourselves for a Sentence not to be heard without trembling—I tell you that none of these Men that were bidden, shall taste of my Supper,—The Marriage Supper of the Lamb in Heaven.","Gyn arragh y ghra, t’ou brasnaghey Jee dy chooilley Laa ny smoo as ny smoo dy ghoaill e Ghrayse Void,—Dy aagail oo gys yn Ymmyrkey-bea mee-chrauee ayd hene, derrey vees oo er lhieeney seose Towse dty Pheccaghyn, as er hayrn ort hene y Vriwnys shen nagh vod v’er ny chlashtyn, gyn ve er-creau—Ta mee ginsh diu nagh jean Fer jeusyn v’er nyn guirrey, blashtyn jeh my Hibber,—Eer Shibber Poosee yn Eayn ayns Niau."
"How great then must the Sin of those be, who neglect to administer, and of those who turn their Back Upon this Ordinance, upon which our Salvation depends? It being the Blood of Christ which must cleanse us from all Sin,—1 John i. 7.","Nagh mooar eisht shegin da’n Peccah ocsyn y ve, ta lhiggey shaghey dy hirveish, as y Peccah ocsyn ta chyndaa nyn Gooyl rish yn Oardaghey shoh, er ta’n Saualtys ain lhie?

"AFTER all, this is not to encourage any Person to go to the Lord’s Supper without a Wedding-garment, without a due [53] regard gard to the Duty.—For a Man may go so unworthily as to receive Judgment, instead of a Blessing.—For Example, Such as live in any known Sin unrepented of;—Such as are not sincerely resolved to live, and be governed, by the known Laws of the Gospel; —Such as live at Variance with their Neighbours without being willing to be reconciled;—Such as have done Wrong, and will not make Satisfaction, as they are able: Lastly, Such as go out of mere Custom, without considering the End or Benefit of this","LURG ooilley, cha vel shoh dy choyrlaghey Persoon erbee dy gholl gys Shibber y Chiarn, fegooish y Garmad-Poosee, fegooish arrym cooie [53] da’n Churrym shen.—Son foddee Dooinney goll cha neu-feeu shen as dy hoilchin Briwnys ayns ynnyd Bannaght.—Ta shen dy ghra, Lheid as ta beaghey ayns Peccah erbee er-fys"

"All such ought to know, that they went unworthily; and if they have any true Concern for their Souls, they will consider better, and lay themselves under stricter Obligations, before they go again to the Lord’s Supper.","Lhisagh ooilley nyn Lheid shoh toiggal, dy jagh ad dy neu-feeu; as my ta veg y Gheill firrinagh oc da nyn Anmeenyn, hig ad gys Smooinaghtyn share, as ver ad ad-hene fo Kianglaghyn s’troshey roish my jed ad reesht gys Shibber y Chiarn."
"But then let them not, at the Peril of their Souls, deal deceitfully, and make this a Pretence of neglecting to go to this Ordinance for the future; lest they provoke God to leave them to [54] themselves, which is one of the greatest Judgments that can befal them.","Agh ny lhig daue er Gaue Anmey, molley ad hene, as shoh y yannoo ny Leshtal son lhiggey shaghey dy gholl gys yn Oardaghey shoh son y Traa ta ry heet; er-aggle dy brasnee ad Jee dy aagail ad daue [54] hene, ta unnane jeh ny Briwnyssyn s’trimmey oddys tuittym orroo."
"On the other hand, let not any well-meaning Christian be discouraged with Fears of having gone unworthily to the Lord’s Supper, and so forbear, because they do not find all the Benefit and Change wrought in them which they hoped for; but let them consider, that a State of Holiness and Perfection is not to be expected at once, but by Degrees, and as we make good Use of the Graces, which the holy Spirit from time to time vouchsafes us:","Er y Laue elley, ny lhig da Creestee mie-aignagh erbee v’er ny choyrt ass Cree lesh Aggle dy vel eh er gholl dy neu-feeu gys Shibber y Chiarn, as myr shen lhiggey shaghey, kyndagh nagh vel ad feddyn ooilley yn Vondeish as y Caghlaa obbrit ayndoo v’ad treishteil er y hon; agh lhig daue Tastey ‘ghoaill, nagh vel Stayd dy Chasherickys as Bea firrinagh Creestee dy ve jerkit rish er y chooyl, agh ny veggan as ny veggan, as ‘naght myr ta shin jannoo Ymmyd vie jeh ny Grayseyn, s’cooidsave lesh y Spyrryd Noo veih Traa gy Traa ‘chur dooin."
"A good Christian not being one, who has no Inclination to Sin, but one, who thro’ the Grace of God immediately checks, and suffers not such Inclinations to grow into evil Habits.","Fakin nagh nee Creestee mie Fer, nagh vel veg yn Yeearree echey gys Peccah, agh Fer, ta trooid Grayse Yee chelleeragh Smaghtaghey, as nagh vel surranse lheid ny Yeearreeyn dy aase gys drogh Chliaghtaghyn."
"God, who knows our Infirmities, will accept our sincere Endeavours, tho’ attended with Imperfeclions and Backslidings, provided we condemn ourselves for them, and strive to amend.","Jee, ta toiggal ny Annooinidyn ain, nee soiaghey jeh nyn Ynrickys, ga nagh vel eh cheet seose gys slane Towse nyn Gurrym, my she shen dy vel shin deyrey shin hene er y hon, as streeu dy lhiassaghey nyn Mea."
"And let us remember for our Comfort, that Jesus Christ himself pronounced all his Disciples (the Traitor [55] excepted) to be clean, that is, qualified to receive this Sacrament, which he was going to administer to them, altho’ he knew them to be subject to very great Failings and Infirmities; which soon appeared, when they all forsook him, contrary to their solemn Promises; but this they repented of, and were forgiven by their compassionate Redeemer.","As lhig dooin cooinaghtyn son nyn Gherjagh, dy ren Yeesey Creest eh-hene genmys ooilley e Oltyllyn, (cheu-mooie [55] jeh’n Traitoor) dy ve glen, ta shen, dy ve feeu dy ghoaill y Chreestiaght shen, v’eshyn goll dy hirveish orroo, ga va fys echey dy row ad aarloo dy huittym ayns Failleilyn as Annooinidyn feer vooar ; quoid va dy leah er ny akin, tra ren ad ooilley y hreigeil eh, noi nyn yarroo Ghialdynyn; agh shoh ghow ad Arrys jeh, as ve leiht daue liorish nyn Ver-kionnee chymmoil."
"If therefore you love God, and your Neighbour, tho’ not so fervently as you could wish;—If you have a real Desire of being better, than at present you find yourself to be—If the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, tho’ in a very low Degree, do appear in your Life—Lastly, if you do daily pray for God’s Grace, that you may, in his good time, be, and do, what he would have you to be, and do not live in any known Sin;—By no means forbear to go to his Ordinance, as often as you have an Opportunity, and depend upon God’s Blessing, and an Increase of his Graces.","Shen-y-fa my ta Graih ayd’s er Jee, as er dty Naboo, ga nagh vel eh cha jeean as wooishagh oo;—My ta Yeearree firrinagh ayd dy ve ny share, na t’ou gennaghtyn oo hene dy ve ec y Traa t’ayn—My ta Messyn y Spyrryd Noo, ga ayns Cooid ny veggan, er ny akin ayns dty Ymmyrkey-bea—Er-jerrey, my t’ou gagh laa goaill Padjer son Grayseyn Yee, dy vod oo, ‘sy Traa mie echeysyn, y ve, as jannoo, myr t’eshyn dty harey, as nagh vel oo beaghey ayns Peccah erbee er-fys dhyt;—Ny lhig shaghey er Aght erbee dy gholl gys yn Oardaghey echey, cha mennick as te er ny hirveish, as foddee oo ve shickyr jeh Bannaght Yee, as Bishaghey jeh e Ghrayseyn."

Who are ashamed of Thee, and of thy Gospel, out of regard to Men? Who by their unchristian Lives do renounce thy Service?—Do they [64] consider what it is to be denied by Thee?—What it is to have no Interest in thy Death, thy Merits, and Mediation?—Gracious God, deliver me from this dreadful Sin and Judgment.","Cre whilleen ta gobbal uss, O Yeesey, gyn Tort, as gyn Aggle! Vel fys oc cre t’ad dy yannoo, ta cha neu-hastagh chyndaa nyn Ghreeym rish yn Oardaghey shoh? Nagh vel jannoo agh Craid jeh nyn Beccaghyn, chost dhyt’s dty Vioys?—Ta goaill Nearey jeed’s as jeh dty Hushtal, ayns Ammys Gheiney?—Ta liorish nyn Mea neu-chreestee treigeil dty Hirveishys?

"St. Matt. xxvi. 35—Peter said, Tho’ I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee.","Noo Mian xxvi. 35. Dooyrt Peddyr, ga dy beign dou goll dy Baase mayrt, cha nobbin oo."
"Preserve me, gracious Lord, from a presumptuous Opinion, and Dependence on my own Strength, without the Aids of thy Grace: Let me see, in this sad Instance, my Weakness without thy Assistance, and my Ruin without thy Help.","Freill mish, Hiarn ghraysoil, veih Smooinaghtyn daaney, as Treishteil foalsey er my Niart hene, fegooish Kemmyrk dty Ghrayse: Ayns y Vac-soyley trimshagh shoh, lhig dou fakin my Annooinid fegooish dty Niart, as my Hoyrt-mow fegooish dty Chooney’s."
"St. Luke xxii. 61, 62. And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the Words of Christ,—and went out and wept bitterly.","Noo Luke xxii. 61, 62. As hyndaa yn Chiarn, as yeeagh eh er Peddyr, as chooinee Peddyr er Goan Chreest,—as hie eh magh as cheayn eh dy sharroo."
"O Jesus, look upon me with the same Eye of Compassion, whenever I shall do amiss, that I may see my Fault, and forthwith return to my Duty:—Let this Instance of thy Mercy be our Comfort, since so great and repeated a Crime did not exclude this Penitent from thy Mercy; but let not this make us fearless of offending Thee, lest we never repent. [65]","O Yeesey, jeeagh orrym’s lesh y Tooill cheddin dy Hymmey, cre-erbee yn Traa nee’m ass y Raad, dy voddym my Oill y akin, as er-y-chooyl chyndaa gys my Churrym:—Lhig da’n Cowrey shoh jeh dty Vyghin ve yn gerjagh aym’s, fakin nagh ren Foill wheesh as cha mennick jeant giarey magh yn Arryssagh shoh veih dty Vyghin; agh ny lhig da shoh shinyn y yannoo [65] mee-agglagh dy vrasnaghey, er-aggle nagh gow mayd dy bragh Arrys."
"St. Luke xxii. 3, 4, 5. Then entered Satan into Judas, and he communed with the Chief Priests, how he might betray him unto them:—And they covenanted to give him Money, &c.","Noo Luke xxii. 3, 4, 5. Eisht hie yn Drogh-spyrryd stiagh ayns Yuaase as ghow eh Coyrle rish ny Ard-saggyrtyn mychione eh y vrah daue:—as ren ad Conaant dy chur Argid da, &c."
"If I should provoke Thee, O God, by resitting thy Holy Spirit, to leave me to my own natural Corruption, and to the Power of Satan, I see, in this wretched Man, what Wickedness I am capable of.—Lord God, abandon me not to my own Choices:—Shut my Heart against that Covetousness, which was the Root of so great a Sin. Keep me from presumptuous Sins, lest they get the Dominion over me; and secure me under the Conduct of thy Holy Spirit, for Jesus Christ’s sake.","My yinnin’s uss y vrasnaghey, O Yee, liorish shassoo magh noi dty Spyrryd Noo, dy aagail mee gys Neu-ghlenid my Ghooghys hene, as gys Pooar y Drogh-spyrryd, ta mee fakin, liorish y Dooinney mollee shoh, cre’n Vee-chraueeaght oddin ve kyndagh jeh.—Hiarn Yee, ny faag uss mish da my Yeearreeyn hene: —Dooin my Chree noi yn Taynt shen, va Fraue jeh lheid y Peccah eajee. Freill mee veih Peccaghyn dy Ghaanys er dty Vyghin, nagh vow ad yn Varriaght orrym; as freill mee fo Leeideilys dty Spyrryd Noo, er graih Yeesey Creest."
"Deut. xvi. 16. They shall not appear before the Lord empty: every Man shall give as he is able, according to the Blessing of the Lord thy God, which he hath given thee.","Deut. xvi. 16. Cha jig uss lesh Laue follym fenish y Chiarn: ver dy chooilley Ghooinney rere e Fort, cordail rish Bannaght y Chiarn dty Yee, t’eh er choyrt dhyt."
"Shall I appear before thee, O God, worse than a Jew?—Can I give any thing to thy Poor, but what I have received from thee? How can I say that I love Thee [66] much, if I give sparingly to them, whom thou hast appointed in thy Place to receive our Alms? Give me an Heart, O God, to give according to thy Blessing upon me, and as I expect thy Blessing upon myself and Substance.","Jig-yms ayns dty Enish, O Yee, ny smessey na Hew?—Voddym Nhee erbee y choyrt da ny Boghtyn ayd’s, agh ny ta mee er gheddyn void’s?

"1 Pet. iv. 10. As every Man hath received the Gift, even so minister the same one to another as good Stewards.","1 Peddyr iv. 10. Myr ta dy chooilley Ghooinney er gheddyn y Gioot, dy jarroo myr shen shirveish-jee yn chooid cheddin yn derrey yeh er y jeh elley, myr Stiurtyn mie."
"O God, who has taught us, that we are all but thy Stewards—Keep me from that great Injustice of defrauding thy Poor of their Right: Give me Grace to moderate all my vain Desires and Expences, that I may have to give to them that need, and that the Measure of thy Blessings to me may be the Measure of my Charity to others.","O Yee; t’er n’ynsaghey dooin nagh vel shin ooilley agh Stiurtyn foyd—Freill mish, ta mee guee ort, veih’n Vee-chairys vooar shen dy volley dty Voghtyn’s jeh nyn Gair: Cur Grayse dou dy smaghtaghey ooilley my Yeearreeyn fardalagh, as my Vaarail, dy vod ve aym dy chur dauesyn t’ayns Feme,—As dy vod y Towse jeh dty Vannaghtyn dooys, ve yn Towse jeh’n Ghiastyllys aym’s da feallagh elley."
