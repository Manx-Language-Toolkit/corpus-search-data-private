CREENAGHT SOLOMON,WISDOM OF SOLOMON
Cab. I ,
"1 Eiyr-jee da’n ynrickys, shiuish vriwnyn ny hooirey: smooinee-jee er y Chiarn lesh cree mie as ayns ynrickys cree shir-jee huggey. ","1 Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him."
2 Son bee eh er ny gheddyn lioroosyn nagh vel dy vrasnaghey eh: as t’eh soilshaghey eh hene dauesyn nagh vel jannoo mee-hreishteil er. ,2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.
"3 Son ta smooinaghtyn camlaagagh scarrey shin veih Jee: as ta e phooar, tra te er ny vrasnaghey, smaghtaghey ny mee-cheeayllee. ","3 For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise."
4 Son ayns annym goanlyssagh cha jean creenaght tannaghtyn; ny cummal ayns y challin ta fo ream peccah. ,4 For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.
"5 Son nee yn spyrryd casherick dy ynsaghey chea veih molteyrys, as scughey veih smooinaghtyn neu-hushtagh, as cha nuirree eh raad ta neu-ynrickys cheet stiagh. ","5 For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in."
"6 Son ta creenaght ny spyrryd graihagh: as cha jean eh seyrey yn mollaghtagh ayns e ghoan; son ta Jee feanish cheu-sthie jeh, as dy baghtal cur-my-ner e chree, as clashtyn e ghoan. ","6 For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue."
"7 Son ta spyrryd y Chiarn lhieeney yn seihll: as t’eshyn, ta cummal seose dagh nhee, toiggal e choraa. ",7 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.
"8 Shen-y-fa cha vod eshyn ve keillit ta loayrt goan mee-chrauee; chamoo nee chooilleeney, tra t’ee kerraghey, shaghney eh. ","8 Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him."
"9 Son bee briaght jeant ayns coyrleyn yn er mee-chrauee; as nee coraa e ghoan roshtyn gys y Chiarn, dy hoilshaghey e obbraghyn peccoil. ",9 For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.
"10 Son ta’n chleaysh eadolagh clashtyn dy chooilley nhee, chamoo ta’n accan trughanagh er ny cheiltyn. ",10 For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.
"11 Shen-y-fa faag-jee veue tallagh gyn-foaynoo as smaght-jee nyn jengey veih cooyl-chassid: son cha vel fockle erbee cha follit shen, nagh bee er ny vriwnys; as ta’n beeal breagagh stroie yn annym. ","11 Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul."
12 Ny shir-jee baase liorish shaghrynys nyn mea: as ny tayrn-jee erriu hene toyrt-mow lesh obbyr nyn laueyn. ,12 Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.
13 Son cha chroo Jee yn baase: chamoo ta taitnys echey ayns toyrt-mow ny bioee. ,13 For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.
14 Son chroo eshyn dy chooilley nhee dy ve beayn: as va sheelogheyn y theihll slayntoil: as cha vel pyshoon dy varvaanys ayndoo: ny reeriaght y vaaish er yn ooir. ,"14 For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:"
15 Son ta ynrickys dy bragh beayn. ,15 (For righteousness is immortal:)
"16 Agh ren deiney mee-chrauee lesh nyn yannoo, as nyn ghoan, [baase] y hayrn orroo hene: son tra smooinee ad dy beagh eh nyn garrey, hie ad naardey, as ren ad conaant rish, toilliu dy ghoaill ayrn mârish. ","16 But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it."

"1 Son dooyrt ny mee-chrauee, resooney roo hene, agh dy aggairagh, Giare as deinagh ta nyn laghyn, as noi baase dooinney cha vel saase erbee, chamoo ve rieau er ny chlashtyn, dy ren dooinney erbee chyndaa veih’n oaie. ","1 For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave."
"2 Son she marran haink shin er y theihll: as bee mayd ny yeï shoh myr nagh beagh rieau nyn lheid ayn: son cha vel yn ennal t’ayns nyn stroanyn myr jaagh, as myr drillin beg ta greesaghey ayns nyn gree: ","2 For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:"
"3 Cooid, tra te er ny vooghey, bee nyn gallin er ny hyndaa gys leoie, as nee nyn spyrryd lheïe ersooyl myr kiunid yn aer veeley. ","3 Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,"
"4 As bee eer nyn annym er ny yarrood lurg traa, as cha bee nyn obbraghyn ayns cooinaghtyn ec dooinney erbee, as nee nyn mioys shymley ersooyl myr scheïm dy vodjal, as bee eh er ny skeayley myr kay ta er ny imman roish gollyn ny greïney, as er ny lheïe lesh yn chiass echey. ","4 And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof."
"5 Son cha vel nyn mea agh eer scadoo ta lheïe ersooyl: as lurg nyn maase cha vel chyndaa: son te shickyr dooint, myr shen nagh vel dooinney erbee chyndaa reesht. ","5 For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again."
"6 Tar-jee eisht, lhig dooin nyn soylley ’ghoaill jeh ny nheeghyn mie ta roïn: as lhig dooin dy jeean ymmyd y yannoo jeh ny bannaghtyn shoh myr ayns nyn aegid. ","6 Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth."
"7 Lhig dooin shin hene y lhieeney lesh feeyn costal as ooilyn miljey, as ny lhig da blaa erbee souree shaghney shin. ",7 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:
8 Lhig dooin nyn ghing y choamrey lesh roseyn ayns slane blaa. ,"8 Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:"
"9 Ny lhig da fer j’in goll fegooish ayrn jeh nyn rouanys: lhig dooin cowraghyn jeh nyn ghennallys y aagail ayns dy chooilley voayl: son shoh nyn doghyr, as nyn gronney shoh. ","9 Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this."
"10 Lhig dooin yn kercheen boght shen dy ghooinney cairal y hranlaasey, gyn sparail y ven-treoghe, ny cur arrym da kione lheeah yn chendeeaght. ","10 Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged."
11 Lhig da laue-lajerys goaill niart er leigh as cairys: son cha vel fort ec ny annoonee dy hassoo roïn. ,11 Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.
"12 Shen-y-fa lhig dooin lhie cooyl-chlea son yn dooinney ynrick; son cha vel eh gys yn ymmyd ain: t’eh soiaghey eh hene noi nyn yannoo, t’eh goltooaney shin lesh brishey yn leigh, as gys nyn nearey coyrt ass nyn lieh shaghrynys nyn ghrogh-ynsaghey. ","12 Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education."
"13 T’eh goaill er dy vel echey tushtey dy Yee, as t’eh genmys eh hene lhiannoo yn Chiarn. ",13 He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.
14 T’eh soiaghey seose eh hene dy choyrt oghsan da ny smooinaghtyn ain. ,14 He was made to reprove our thoughts.
"15 T’eh seaghnagh dooin eer dy yeeaghyn er: son cha vel y vea echeysyn casley rish bea gheiney elley, ny e raaidyn myr ny raaidyn ocsyn. ","15 He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion."
"16 T’eh jeeaghyn orrin myr kialgeyryn, t’eh shaghney myr breinid nyn gliaghtaghyn: t’eh lhiasaghey dy vel jerrey yn sleih cairagh dy ve bannit, as boggyssagh dy vel Jee yn ayr echey. ","16 We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father."
17 Lhig dooin fakin vel firrinys ayns e ghoan: as hee mayd cre haghyrys da ec y jerrey. ,17 Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.
"18 Son my ta’n dooinney ynrick mac dy Yee, nee eh cooney lesh, as livrey eh veih laue e noidyn. ","18 For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies."
"19 Lhig dooin eshyn y phrowal lesh goanlys as torchaghey, dy vod mayd fakin e veenid, as prowal e hurranse. ","19 Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience."
20 Lhig dooin eh y cherraghey lesh baase scammyltagh: son my sheer da hene bee soiaghey jeant jeh. ,20 Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.
"21 She myr shoh smooinnee ad, agh v’ad mollit: son ta nyn mee-chraueeaght hene er gholley ad. ","21 Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them."
"22 Agh son folliaghtyn Yee, cha row geill oc daue, chamoo v’ad jeeaghyn son faill yn ynrickys, chamoo va scansh oc jeh leagh son anmeenyn gyn-loght. ","22 As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls."
"23 Son chroo Jee dooinney dy ve dy bragh beayn, as ren eh cummey eh ayns tuarystal e veaynid hene. ","23 For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity."
"24 Ny-yeih, trooid goanlys y jouyl haink baase stiagh sy theihll: myr t’adsyn gennaghtyn ta fo e reill. ",24 Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.

2 Er-lesh ny mee-cheeayllee dy row ad geddyn baase: as dy row ad paartail gys seaghyn. ,"2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,"
3 As nyn immeeaght dy ve slane toyrt-mow: agh t’adsyn ayns shee. ,3 And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.
4 Son ga dy vel ad seaghnit fenish deiney: foast t’ad ayns slane treishteil yn vaynrys veayn. ,"4 For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality."
"5 As lurg nyn seaghyn giare bee ad dy mooar er ny chooilleeney: son ta Jee er phrowal, as er gheddyn ad dy ve feeu jeh hene. ","5 And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself."
"6 Myr airh ayns y choirrey t’eh er phrowal ad, as er ghoaill roo myr slane oural taitnyssagh. ","6 As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering."
7 Agh ayns laa nyn mriwnys nee ad soilshean: as roie noon as noal myr smayllyn mastey’n stubbyl. ,"7 And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble."
"8 Nee ad briwnys ny ashoonyn, as bee oc ream harrish y pobble, as nee yn Chiarn oc reill er son dy bragh. ","8 They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever."
"9 Nee e hreishteilee toiggal yn ynrickys: as nee adsyn ta firrinagh ayns graih tannaghtyn mârish: son ta grayse as myghin cour e nooghyn, as jeh e chloan reiht t’eh goaill ard-chiarail. ","9 They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect."
"10 Agh bee ny mee-chrauee er nyn gerraghey ’syn ardalys oc hene, ta er hoiaghey beg jeh deiney mie, as er hreigeil y Chiarn. ","10 But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord."
"11 Son quoi-erbee ta soiaghey beg jeh creenaght as ynsaghey, t’eh ny vouran: as ta nyn dreishteil ayns fardail, nyn laboraght neu-vessoil, as nyn obbraghyn neu-vondeishagh. ","11 For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:"
"12 Ta ny mraane oc mee-cheeayllagh, as nyn gloan er drogh-ynsagh. ","12 Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:"
"13 Ta’n sluight oc fo mollaght: shen-y-fa bannit ta’n ven ghennish, nagh vel er n’yannoo peccah, nagh vel er n’eiyrt er maarderys: bee sluight eck ayns briwnys ny anmeenyn. ","13 Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls."
"14 As bannit ta’n dooinney gennish nagh vel lesh y laueyn er n’eiyrt da mee-chairys, ny ayns drogh smooinaghtyn noi Jee: son dasyn vees er ny choyrt yn ard-yioot dy chredjue, as cronney ayns chiamble y Chiarn, ny s’ennoil ayns e aigney.

15 Son s’gloyroil ta’n mess dy obbraghyn mie! as cha jean y fraue dy chreenaght dy bragh failleil. ,15 For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.

"2 Tra te kionfenish ta deiney goaill sampleyr veih: as tra te er n’immeeaght t’ad dy yeearree eh, te ceau attey, as cosney yn varriaght, as laue yn eaghtyr son dy bragh, lurg streeu son leaghyn nagh jed naardey. ","2 When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards."
"3 Agh cha jean sluight raahoil ny mee-chrauee cheet er-ash, ny fraue dowin y ghoaill veih settyn oainjyragh, ny troggal er undin shickyr. ","3 But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fast foundation."
"4 Son ga dy vel ny banglaneyn oc blaaghey son tammylt; foast, myr nagh vel ad soit dy shickyr, bee ad craait lesh y gheay, as trooid niart ny geayee bee ad astrit ass ny fraueyn. ","4 For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out."
"5 Bee ny banglaneyn faase er nyn mrishey jeh, nyn mess neu-ghooghyssagh, gyn appee son beaghey, neu-chooie son ymmyd erbee. ","5 The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing."
6 Son bee cloan oainjeragh nyn veanishyn noi drogh-yannoo nyn ayraghyn as nyn moiraghyn ayns laa ny briwnys. ,6 For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.

"8 Son cha vel eash ooasle er ny howse liorish traa liauyr, ny er ny choontey veih mooarane bleeantyn. ","8 For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years."
"9 Agh ta creenaght ny chione lheeah da deiney, as bea gyn loght myr shenn eash. ","9 But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age."
"10 Ren eh Jee y wooiys, as ghow Jee taitnys ayn: myr shen veih beaghey mastey peccee ghow Jee eh huggey hene. ","10 He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated."
"11 Dy jarroo v’eh er ny ghoaill ersooyl dy leah, er-aggle dy jinnagh mee-chraueeaght e hoiggal y chaghlaa, ny molteyrys e annym y violaghey. ","11 Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul."
12 Son ta cleayn peccah cur naardey reddyn ta mie ayndoo hene: as ta shaghrynys yeearree neu-chooie cleiy fo yn annym ôney. ,12 For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind.

"14 Son ren e annym yn Chiarn y wooiys, shen-y-fa ren eh siyr dy ghoaill eh veih mastey ny mee-chrauee. ",14 For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked.
"15 Honnick y pobble shoh, agh cha row toiggal oc jeh, chamoo smooinee ad ayns nyn aignaghyn, Dy vel grayse as myghin Yee cour e nooghyn, as dy vel eh jannoo slane soiaghey jeh e chloan reiht. ","15 This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen."
"16 Myr shoh nee yn marroo ynrick deyrey ny mee-chrauee ta foast bio: as nee yn aegid, t’er leeideil bea ghlen, deyrey bleeantyn liauyr as shenn eash ny drogh-yantee. ",16 Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years and old age of the unrighteous.
"17 Son ga t’ad fakin jerrey yn dooinney creeney; cha vel ad toiggal cre ta Jee ayns e choyrle hene er chiarail er e hon, as cre’n-oyr ta’n Chiarn er hoiaghey eh ayns sauchys. ","17 For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall not understand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and to what end the Lord hath set him in safety."
"18 Ver ad my-ner eh, as soiee ad beg jeh: agh bee adsyn ayns faghid ec Jee; as bee ad ny lurg shoh nyn gallinyn eajee, as son oltooan mastey ny merriu er son dy bragh.

"20 As tra t’ad cur stiagh coontey nyn beccaghyn, nee ad shen lesh atchim; as nee eer nyn beccaghyn hene gymmyrkey feanish nyn ’oï. ","20 And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shall come with fear: and their own iniquities shall convince them to their face."

"2 Son tra ghow deiney mee-chrauee orroo dy hranlaasey yn ashoon casherick; myr v’ad jeight seose ayns nyn dhieyn, pryssoonee yn dorraghys, as freilt fo geulaghyn oie liauyr, lhie ad ayns shen, giarit magh veih’n ard-chiarail dy bragh farraghtyn. ","2 For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay there exiled from the eternal providence."
"3 Son smooinaghtyn dy cheiltyn ad hene fo nyn beccaghyn follit, v’ad skeaylt noon as noal fo coodaghey dorraghey dy yarroodys, agglit ass nyn geeayll, as seaghnit lesh ashlishyn atchimagh. ","3 For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with strange apparitions."
"4 Son chamoo oddagh yn cooill dorraghey shen, ayn v’ad lhie, ad y reayll voish aggle, agh sheean [myr jeh ushtaghyn] feiyral mygeayrt-y-moo, as shillaghyn agglagh v’er ny akin lioroo lesh eddinyn graney groamagh. ","4 For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances."
5 Cha row bree yn aile dy choyrt soilshey daue: chamoo oddagh sollyssid soilshean ny rollageyn surranse dy cheau soilshey ’syn oie atchimagh cheddin. ,5 No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.
"6 Ynrycan honnick ad aile foaddit jeh hene, feer agglagh; son myr v’ad fo mooarane atchim, er-lhieu dy row shen honnick ad ny smessey na ny shillaghyn nagh vaik ad. ","6 Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not."
"7 Agh son molteyrys nyn obbeeys v’ad er nyn gastey, as hooar boggyssagh nyn ysseree oghsan naareydagh. ","7 As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace."
"8 Son adsyn ghow orroo dy eiyrt ersooyl atchim as anvea veih annym seaghnit, v’ad hene seaghnit lesh aggle faghidagh. ","8 For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at."
"9 Son ga nagh row oc oyr erbee dy aggle; ny-yeih v’ad ec kione nyn geiley, mannagh row agh y maase goll shaghey, as ec tassane ard-nieughyn, ","9 For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,"
"10 As hooar ad baase son aggle, gra, Nagh vaik ad yn aer, va mygeayrt-y-moo er dy chooilley heu. ","10 They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided."

","11 For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things."
"12 Son cha vel aggle monney arragh, agh brah yn chooney shen ta nyn resoon dy hebbal dooin. ",12 For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.
"13 As my sloo t’ad seaghnit cheu-sthie, wheesh shen s’trimmey hig orroo kerraghey nyn mee-hushtey. ","13 And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment."
"14 Agh adsyn nyn lhie fo cadley trome yn oie cheddin, va dy jarroo atchimagh, as nagh dod shaghney shen haink orroo veih diunidyn niurin. ","14 But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,"

","15 Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them."
"16 Myr shen, cre-erbee yn raad huitt fer ny lhie, shen y raad duirree eh, myr dooint ’sy phryssoon gyn boltyn yiarn. ","16 So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,"

","17 For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness."
"18 Edyr eh ve geay rastagh, ny bingys eeanlee kiaulleeaght mastey banglaneyn ny biljyn, ny feiyr ushtey tuittym veih’n yrjid, ","18 Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,"

"20 Son harrish yn chooid elley jeh’n theihll va’n soilshey sollys soilshean, as cha row unnane erbee er nyn lhiettal ayns nyn obbyr. ","20 For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:"

"2 Agh er-yn-oyr nagh ren ad skielley daue nish, lioroo hurr ad aggair roïe, hug ad booise daue, as ghuee ad leih orroo, son dy row ad roïe nyn noidyn.

"3 Ayns ynnyd y chooid cheddin, hug oo daue pillar lossey dy aile, dy ve chammah leeideilagh daue er nyn yurnah gyn-oayl, as grian breeoil dy chur soilshey ooasle daue.

"5 As tra v’ad kiarit dy stroie oikanyn dty chloan chasherick, myr va un lhiannoo er ny hilgey magh, as er ny hauail dy chur oghsan daue, ghow uss ersooyl earroo nyn ghloan, as stroie oo ad ooilley cooidjagh ayns ny ushtaghyn mooarey. ","5 And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water."
"6 Jeh’n oie shen va nyn ayraghyn er ny hickyraghey ro-laue, myr va fysseree firrinagh oc gys cre ny breearraghyn v’ad er choyrt nyn marrant, oddagh ad ny lurg shen ve jeh gien mie. ","6 Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterwards be of good cheer."
"7 Shoh myr hooar dty phobble yn vondeish, chammah jeh saualtys y vooinjer chairail,[21] as jeh toyrt-mow nyn noidyn. ","7 So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous, and destruction of the enemies."
"8 Son lesh shen ren uss nyn noidyn y cherraghey, lesh y chooid cheddin t’ou uss er ghloyraghey shinyn dty chloan reiht. ","8 For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called."
"9 Son ren cloan chrauee deiney mie ouralley dy follit, as lesh un aigney ren ad leigh casherick, dy beagh ny nooghyn ayns paarteeas ry-cheilley chammah ayns maynrys as seaghyn, nyn ayraghyn nish fockley-magh arraneyn-moyllee. ","9 For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise."
"10 Agh er y cheu elley va er ny chlashtyn eam atchimagh ny noidyn, as va bardoon trimshagh goll mygeayrt son y chloan v’ad dy ghobberan. ","10 But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed."
"11 Va’n mainshtyr as y charvaant er nyn gerraghey co-laik, as y ree myr dooinney erbee elley. ","11 The master and the servant were punished after one manner; and like as the king, so suffered the common person."
"12 Myr shen va oc ooilley dy cheilley earrooyn erskyn-towse dy verriu, lesh un cheint dy vaase, chamoo va ny bioee dy liooar dy oanluckey ny merriu: son ’sy tullogh va nyn sluight s’ooasle er nyn stroie. ",12 So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.
"13 Son ga nagh jinnagh ad nhee erbee y chredjal fo molteyrys nyn obbeeys; ny-yeih tra honnick ad cragh nyn mec shinney, ghow ad roo shoh dy ve nyn gloan dy Yee. ","13 For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of the enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God."
"14 Son tra va dy chooilley nhee ayns fea as fast, as yn oie shen ayns mean e jurnah siyragh, ","14 For while all things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course,"
"15 Haink dty ghoo’s ooilley-niartal neose doaltattym veih dty stoyl-reeoil ayns niau, myr dooinney-caggee niartal ayns mean cheer kiarit son toyrt-mow. ","15 Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,"

","16 And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth."
"17 Er shoh v’ad seaghnit lesh ashlishyn dy ghreamallyn atchimagh, as haink aggle doaltattym orroo. ","17 Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore, and terrors came upon them unlooked for."
"18 As fer as fer jeu lieh-varroo scaait noon as noal, hoilshee ad oyr nyn maaish. ","18 And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death."
"19 Son va fysseree oc jeh shoh ro-laue veih nyn ghreamallyn seaghnagh, nagh jinnagh ad cherraghtyn gyn toiggal cre’n oyr v’ad seaghnit. ","19 For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted."

","20 Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, and there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but the wrath endured not long."
"21 Son eisht ren y [22] dooinney bannee siyr, as hass eh magh dy endeil ad; as cur lesh scape e hirveish cooie, eer padjer, as lhiasaghey incense, hass eh eddyr adsyn as y jymmoose, as shen myr ren eh yn arkys y lhiettal, soilshaghey dy row eh dty harvaant. ","21 For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant."
"22 Shoh myr hooar eh barriaght er y stroieder, cha nee lesh troshid corp, chamoo lesh eilley-caggee, agh lesh fockle hug eh fo-chosh yn cragheyder, liorish lhiasaghey ny breearraghyn, as ny conaantyn, va jeant rish ny ayraghyn.

"23 Son tra va ny merriu nish er duittym sheese ayns carnaneyn yn derrey yeh er y jeh elley, shassoo eddyr ad, ren eh castey yn jymmoose, as lhiettal y raad gys ny bioee.

"24 Son ayns y choamrey liauyr va slane aalid, as ayns ny kiare roaghyn dy chlaghyn costal va grainnit gloyr ny ayraghyn, as dty ard-ooashley er attey e chione.

"25 Daue shoh hug y stroieder raad, myr v’eh ’syn ammys oc: son s’lioar ve daue agh blass jeh e yymmoose y gheddyn. ","25 Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath."

Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished."

"14 As haink eh dy ve ny hiarn jeh ooilley ny ard-valjyn echey, as haink eh gys Ecbatane, as ghow eh ny tooryn, as hug eh naardey ny straidyn echey, as hyndaa eh aalid y chooid cheddin gys nearey.

"15 Ghow eh myrgeddin Arphaxad ayns sleityn Regau, as woaill eh trooid eh lesh e shleiyghyn, as hug eh mow dy bollagh eh er y laa shen. ","15 He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smote him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day."

","1 Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel."

"2 O Hiarn Yee dy m'ayr Simeon, da hug oo cliwe dy ghoaill kerraghey er ny joarreeyn, ren cryss ben aeg y eaysley dy ghoaill er egin ee, as yn cleeaysid y roostey gys y nearey eck, as vhill yn voidynys eck dy hayrn scammylt urree; son dooyrt uss, Cha negin da ve myr shen, (as foast shen myr ren ad:) ","2 O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:"
"3 Shen-y-fa hug oo ny reiltee oc dy ve currit gy baase, myr shen dy ren ad nyn lhiabbee y ghaaghey ayns fuill, kyndagh rish nyn molteyrys, as va ny sharvaantyn stroit marish nyn jiarnyn, as ny chiarnyn er nyn stuill-reeoil; ","3 Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that they dyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones;"

","4 And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dear children; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also a widow."
"5 Son t'ou uss er n'yannoo cha nee ny-lomarcan ny reddyn shoh, agh myrgeddin ny reddyn haink gy kione roie, as ny reddyn haink ny lurg shen; t'ou er n'ghoaill baght jeh ny reddyn ta nish ayn, as shen ny ta ry-heet.

"8 Ceau sheese y niart oc ayns dty phooar, as cur lhiat sheese y tranlaase oc ayns dty eulys: son t'ad kiarit dy yannoo neu-ghlen jeh dty ynnyd casherick, as dy vhilley dty chabbane-agglish raad ta dt'ennym gloyroil goaill fea, as dy hilgey sheese lesh y chliwe eairk dt’altar.

"4 As hug ee braagyn er e cassyn, as hug ee mo’ee e boandaghyn-mhuinneel, as e fainaghyn-cleayshey, as ooilley e jesheenyn, as ren ee ee-hene y hoiaghey magh dy braew, son dy chleaynaghey sooillyn dy chooilley ghooinney yinnagh fakin ee.

"6 Myr shoh hie ad magh gys giat ard-valley Vethulia, as hooar ad ny shassoo ayns shen Osias, as shanstyryn yn ard-valley, Chabris as Charmis. ","6 Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris and Charmis."
"7 As tra honnick ad ee, dy row yn eddin eck ceaghlit, as e coamrey er ny chaghlaa, ghow ad yindys mooar jeh’n aalid eck, as dooyrt ad ree, ","7 And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, and said unto her."

"11 Myr shoh jimmee ad jeeragh magh ’sy choan: as veeit yn chied arrey jeh ny Assyrianee ee, ","11 Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,"

"17 As dooyrt Holofernes ree, Iu nish, as bee reagh marin. ","17 Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry with us."

","2 And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down."
"3 Eisht gowee adsyn nyn eillaghyn, as hed ad ayns nyn gamp, as troggee ad seose captanyn armee Assur, as nee ad roie gys cabbane Holofernes, agh cha vow ad eh: eisht tuittee aggle orroo, as nee ad chea roish yn eddin eu. ","3 Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face."
"4 Myr shen hed shiuish as ooilley ny ta cummal ayns ardjyn Israel er yn eiyrtys oc, as ad y stroie myr t'ad goll. ","4 So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursue them, and overthrow them as they go."

","5 But before ye do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite, that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to us as it were to his death."

","6 Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and when he was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand in the assembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his spirit failed."
"7 Agh tra hooar ad eh currit lesh huggey-hene reesht, huitt eh ec cassyn Yudith, as ren eh ammys j’ee, as dooyrt eh, Bannit t'ou uss ayns ooilley cabbane Yuda, as ayns dy chooilley ashoon, tra nee ad clashtyn dt’ennym’s gowee ad yindys. ","7 But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet, and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the tabernacles of Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy name shall be astonished."
"8 Nish er-y-fa shen insh dou ooilley ny reddyn t'ou er n'yannoo ayns ny laghyn shoh.

Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of the people all that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hour she spake unto them."
"9 As tra v'ee erreish loayrt, dyllee yn pobble lesh ard-choraa, as ren ad sheean gerjoil 'syn ard-valley oc. ","9 And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city."

","10 And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day."
"11 As cha leah as va'n moghrey er jeet rish, crogh ad kione Holofernes er y voalley, as ghow dagh dooinney e wappinyn, as jimmee ad magh ayns sheshaghtyn gys glionteenyn y clieau. ","11 And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they went forth by bands unto the straits of the mountain."
"12 Agh tra honnick ny Assyrianee ad, hug ad fys gys nyn leeideilee, quoi haink gys nyn gaptanyn as ny briwnyn, as gys dy chooilley unnane jeh nyn reiltee.

","13 So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed."
14 Eisht hie Bagoas stiagh as chronk eh ec dorrys y chabbane; son heill eh dy row eh ny chadley marish Judith. ,"14 Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent; for he thought that he had slept with Judith."

"16 Shen-y-fa dyllee eh dy ard, lesh keayney, as osnaghey, as eam niartal, as raip eh e gharmadyn. ","16 Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and sighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments."
"17 Lurg shen hie eh stiagh ’sy chabbane raad va Judith goaill aaght: as tra nagh dooar eh ee, lheim eh magh gys y pobble, as deie eh, ","17 After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,"

"19 Tra va captanyn armee ny Assyrianee er chlashtyn ny goan shoh, raip ad nyn gooatyn, as va nyn aignaghyn yindyssagh seaghnit, as va coe as feiyr feer vooar trooid magh yn champ.

"1 As tra v'adsyn v'ayns ny cabbaneyn er chlashtyn jeh, ghow ad niart yindys jeh'n red va jeant. ","1 And when they that were in the tents heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done."

","2 And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was no man that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out all together, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hill country."
"3 Adsyn myrgeddin v'er champal ayns ny sleityn runt mygeayrt-y-mysh Bethulia, hea ad ersooyl. Eisht ren cloan Israel, dagh unnane va ny ghooinney-caggee ny mast'oc, roie magh orroo.

","4 Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Cola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the things that were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies to destroy them."
"5 Nish tra va cloan Israel er chlashtyn shen, huitt ad ooilley orroo lesh un aigney, as ad y stroie er-gys Chobai: myrgeddin adsyn v'er jeet veih Jerusalem as veih cheer-ny-gronk, (son va deiney er n'insh daue cre ny reddyn va jeant ayns camp ny noidyn oc,) as adsyn v'ayns Galaad, as ayns Galilee, d'eiyr ad orroo lesh stroialtys mooar, derrey v'ad shaghey Damascus as ny slystyn echey. ","5 Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof."
"6 As y chooid elley va baghey ec Bethulia, huitt ad er camp Assur, as spooill ad ad, as hooar ad mooarane berchys. ","6 And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched."

","7 And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter had that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were in the mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for the multitude was very great."
"8 Eisht haink Joachim yn ard-saggyrt, as shendiaght cloan Israel va baghey ayns Jerusalem, dy chur-my-ner ny reddyn mie va Jee er hoilshaghey da Israel, as dy akin Judith, as dy ghoaill boggey jee, ","8 Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the children of Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her."
"9 As tra haink ad huic, vannee ad ee lesh un aigney, as dooyrt ad ree, T'ou uss ard-voylley Yerusalem, t’ou uss gloyr vooar Israel, t'ou boggey mooar yn ashoon ain: ","9 And when they came unto her, they blessed her with one accord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem, thou art the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicing of our nation:"

"12 As roie ooilley mraane Israel cooidjagh dy akin ee, as vannee ad ee, as ren ad daunsin y yannoo ny mast'oc er-e-son: as ghow ee banglaneyn ayns e laue, as chur ee myrgeddin da ny mraane va maree.

"1 Eisht hie Judith lesh yn arrane shoh dy hoyrt booise ayns ooilley Israel, as ghow ooilley'n pobble mareeish lesh yn arrane-moyllee shoh. ","1 Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang after her this song of praise."

3 Son ta Jee brishey ny caggaghyn: son mastey ny campyn ayns mean y pobble t'eh er livrey mish ass ny laueyn ocsyn ren my hranlaasey. ,3 For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in the midst of the people he hath delivered me out of the hands of them that persecuted me.

6 Agh ta'n Chiarn Ooilley-niartal er lhiettal ad liorish laue ben. ,6 But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman.
"7 Son cha huitt yn fer niartal liorish ny deiney aegey, chamoo dy ren mec ny Titanee eh y varroo, ny foawir thollee soiagh er: agh ghow Judith inneen Verari yn vree ass lesh aalid e heddin. ","7 For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance."
"8 Son hug ee jee garmad e treoghys son dy hroggal seose adsyn va tranlaasit ayns Israel, as ren ee e heddin y ooillaghey lesh ooill, as chiangle ee e folt ayns quoif, as coamrey aanrit y ghoaill dy chur shaghrynys er. ","8 For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to deceive him."
"9 Hug ny carraneyn eck cleayn er e hooillyn, ghow yn aalid eck seose e aigney, as hie'n cliwe cam trooid e wannal. ","9 Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck."

","18 Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts."
"19 Ren Judith neesht soylley 'ghoaill jeh ooilley cooid Holofernes, va'n pobble er choyrt j'ee, as chur ee yn coodagh, v'ee er n'ghoaill ass e hamyr-lhiabbagh, son gioot gys y Chiarn.

"20 Myr shen ren y pobble tannaghtyn giensal ayns Jerusalem kiongoyrt rish yn ynnyd casherick son choud as three meeaghyn, as duirree Judith maroo. ",20 So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.

","23 But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses."
"24 As ren thie Israel dobberan er-e-son shiaght laa: as my dooar ee baase, rheynn ee e cooid orroosyn ooilley va jeh kynney sniessey Vanasses e sheshey, as orroosyn va jeh'n kynney sniessey eck hene.

"25 As cha row unnane erbee hug aggle er cloan Israel arragh ayns laghyn Yudith, ny son traa liauyr lurg e baaish. ","25 And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death."

"610 Myrgeddin yn tendreil, tra te brishey magh te aashagh dy akin, as er 'naght cheddin ta'n gheay sheidey ayns dy chooilley heer. ",61 In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to be seen; and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.
"62 As tra ta Jee cur sarey da ny bodjallyn dy gholl magh harrish y slane seihll, t'ad jannoo myr t'er ny hirrey orroo. ","62 And when God commandeth the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are bidden."

"64 Er-y-fa shen cha vel eh dy ve smooinit ny grait dy vel ad jeeghyn, fakin nagh vod ad edyr cooishyn y vriwnys, ny foays y yannoo da deiney. ","64 Wherefore it is neither to be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do good unto men."

"67 Chamoo oddys ad cowraghyn y hoilshaghey 'syn aer mastey ny hashoonee, ny soilshean myr y ghrian, ny soilshey 'choyrt myr yn eayst. ","67 Neither can they shew signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon."
"68 Ta ny beiyn maaish ny share na adsyn: son foddee ad geddyn fo fastee, as cooney lhieu-hene. ",68 The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves.
"69 Cha vel eh eisht, er aght erbee, jeeaghyn dooinyn dy vel ad jeeghyn: shen-y-fa nagh gow-jee aggle roue. ",69 It is then by no means manifest unto us that they are gods: therefore fear them not.

"2 As ghow eh ben, va'n ennym eck Susanna, inneen Chelcias, ben feer waagh, as 'nane va goaill aggle roish y Chiarn. ","2 And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord."
"3 Va'n ayr as y voir eck myrgeddin crauee, as dynsee ad yn inneen oc cordail rish leigh Voses. ","3 Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses."
"4 Nish va Joacim dooinney mooar berchagh, as va garey aalin echey lhiantyn gys e hie: as huggeysyn ren ny Hewnyn taaghey; son dy row eh ny smoo ooasle na ooilley'n vooinjer elley. ","4 Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others."
"5 Yn vlein cheddin va jees jeh shanstyryn y pobble pointit dy ve briwnyn, nyn lheid as ren y Chiarn loayrt jeu, dy daink mee-chairys voish Babylon, as voish briwnyn y chenn traa, va jeeaghyn myr dy beagh ad reill y pobble. ","5 The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people."
"6 V'ad shoh cheet dy mennick gys thie Yoacim: as ooilley ny va cooishyn leigh erbee oc, haink ad huc. ",6 These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them.
"7 Nish tra jimmee yn pobble roue ass y raad ec y vunlaa, hie Susanna ayns garey e sheshey dy walkal. ","7 Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband's garden to walk."
8 As honnick yn daa hanstyr ee goll ayn dy chooilley laa [as shooyl] ; myr shen dy row yn yeearree oc jeant er-rouyl huic. ,"8 And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her."
"9 As ren ad nyn aigney hene y ghoalley, as hyndaa ad ersooyl nyn sooillyn, nagh jinnagh ad jeeaghyn gys niau, ny geill y choyrt da briwnysyn cairagh. ","9 And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments."
"10 As ga dy row ad ny-neesht er ny lhottey lesh y ghraih eck, foast cha by-loys da'n derrey yeh e heaghyn y hoilshaghey da’n jeh elley. ","10 And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief."
"11 Son va nearey orroo dy ghoaill-rish nyn yeearree, dy row ad miandagh er geddyn dy yannoo maree. ","11 For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her."
12 Foast yeeagh ad magh dy jeidagh veih laa dy laa d'akin ee. ,12 Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.
"12 As dooyrt yn derrey yeh rish y jeh elley, Lhig dooin nish goll thie: son te traa-mrastyragh. ","13 And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time."
"14 Myr shen tra v'ad ersooyl magh, scar ad veih my-cheilley, as chyndaa reesht haink ad gys yn un voayll; as lurg daue v'er vriaght jeh my-cheilley yn oyr, ghow ad rish nyn yeearree: eisht phoint ad traa ny-neesht cooidjagh, tra oddagh ad geddyn ee ny lomarcan. ","14 So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone."
"15 As haink eh gy kione myr v'ad fieau son traa jesh, dy jagh ee stiagh myr bollagh ee marish daa ven aeg ynrican, as v’ee aignagh dy niee ee-hene 'sy gharey: son ve cheh. ","15 And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot."
"16 As cha row peccagh erbee ayns shen er-lhimmey jeh'n daa hanstyr, v'er n’ollaghey ad-hene, as ceau sooill urree. ","16 And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her."
"17 As dooyrt ee rish ny mraane aegey eck, Cur-jee lhieu hym ooill as sheeabyn, as jeigh-jee dorryssyn y gharey, dy voddym mee-hene y niee. ","17 Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me."

","18 And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid."
"19 Nish tra va ny mraane aegey ersooyl magh, dirree yn daa hanstyr seose, as roie ad huic, gra, ","19 Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying,"
"20 Cur-my-ner, ta dorryssyn y gharey jeight, nagh lheear da dooinney erbee shin, as ta shinyn ayns graih rhyts; shen-y-fa cur dt'aigney lhien, as lhie marin. ","20 Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie with us."
"21 Mannagh jean oo, nee mainyn feanish y ymmyrkey dt'oi, dy row dooinney aeg mayrt: as er-y-fa shen hug oo dty vraane aegey ersooyl void. ","21 If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee."
"22 Eisht dosnee Susanna, as dooyrt ee, Ta mee chionnt er dy chooilley heu: son my nee'ms yn red shoh, te baase dou: as mannagh jean-ym eh, cha voddym scapail ny laueyn euish. ","22 Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape your hands."
"23 Te ny share er-my-hon dy huittym ayns ny laueyn eu, as gyn dy yannoo eh, na dy chur-rish peccah ayns shilley'n Chiarn. ","23 It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord."
24 Er shen dyllee Susannah lesh ard-choraa: as dyllee yn daa hanstyr magh noi eck. ,24 With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.
"25 Eisht roie fer jeu, as doshil eh dorrys y gharey. ","25 Then ran the one, and opened the garden door."
"26 Myr shen tra cheayll sharvaantyn y thie yn yllagh 'sy gharey, ying ad stiagh er dorrys dooint, dy akin c’red va jeant ree. ","26 So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her."
"27 Agh tra va ny shanstyryn er hoilshaghey nyn gooish, va ny sharvaantyn fo niart nearey: son cha row rieau roie lheid y goo shen jeh Susanna. ","27 But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna."
"28 As haink eh gy kione laa-ny-vairagh, tra va'n pobble er haglym gys thie Yoacim e sheshey, dy daink ny shanstyryn myrgeddin lane dy spyrryd olkyssagh noi Susanna dy choyrt ee gy baase; ","28 And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death;"
"29 As dooyrt ad kiongoyrt rish y pobble. Cur-jee fys son Susanna, inneen Chelcias, ben Yoacim; as myr shen hug ad fys. ","29 And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent."
"30 Myr shen haink ee marish e hayr as e moir, e cloan, as ooilley e kynney. ","30 So she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred."
"31 Nish va Susanna ben feer vettey, as slane-aalin dy yeeaghyn urree. ","31 Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold."
32 As hug ny drogh gheiney shoh sarey dy roostey’n eddin eck (son v’ee coodit) dy voddagh ad ve lhieent lesh yn aalid eck. ,"32 And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty."
"33 Shen-y-fa ren e caarjyn, as ooilley ny va fakin ee, keayney. ",33 Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.
"34 Eisht hass y daa hanstyr seose ayns mean y pobble, as lhie ad nyn laueyn er y chione eck. ","34 Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head."
"35 As ish keayney, yeeagh ee seose gys niau: son va e cree treishteil ayns y Chiarn. ",35 And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord.
"36 As dooyrt ny shanstyryn, Myr va shinyn shooyl 'sy gharey ny lomarcan, haink y ven shoh marish daa ven aeg, as jeigh dorryssyn y gharey hug ee ny mraane aegey ersooyl. ","36 And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away."
"37 Eisht dooinney aeg v'ayns shen follit, haink [eh] huic as lhie eh maree. ","37 Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her."
"38 Eisht shinyn, va nyn shassoo ayns corneil jeh'n gharey, fakin yn olk shoh, roie shin huc. ","38 Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness, ran unto them."
"39 As tra honnick shin ad cooidjagh, yn dooinney cha dod shin y chummal: son v'eh ny stroshey na shin, as doshil eh yn dorrys, as lheim eh magh. ","39 And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out."
"40 Agh er n'goaill y ven shoh, vrie shin quoi va’n dooinney aeg, agh cha jinnagh ee ginsh dooin: jeh ny reddyn shoh ta shinyn gymmyrkey feanish. ","40 But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify."
"41 Eisht chreid yn cochruinnaght ad, myr she adsyn va shanstyryn as briwnyn y pobble: myr shen ren ad ee y gheyrey gy baase. ",41 Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders and judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.
"42 Eisht deie Susanna magh lesh ard-choraa, as dooyrt ee, O Yee dy bragh farraghtyn, ta toiggal ny folliaghtyn, as ayd ta fys er dy chooilley nhee ro-laue: ","42 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be:"

","43 Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me."
44 As cheayll y Chiarn e coraa. ,44 And the Lord heard her voice.
"45 Shen-y-fa tra v'ee er ny leeideil dy ve currit dy baase, hrog y Chiarn seose spyrryd crauee scollag aeg; va'n ennym echey Daniel: ","45 Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:"
"46 Quoi deie lesh coraa ard, Ta mish seyr voish fuill y ven shoh. ","46 Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman."
"47 Eish[t] hyndaa ooilley'n sleih ad hene huggey, as dooyrt ad, Cre ta dy ve toiggit liorish ny focklyn shoh t'ou er loayrt? ","47 Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast spoken?"
"48 Eisht, ny hassoo 'sy vean oc, dooyrt eh, Vel shiu lheid ny ommidanyn, shiuish vec Israel, dy vel shiu fegooish feyshtey, ny toiggal jeh'n irriney, er gheyrey inneen jeh Israel?

49 Chyndaa-jee reesht gys ynnyd y vriwnys: son t'ad er n’ymmyrkey feanish foalsey n'oi eck. ,49 Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her.

"51 Eisht dooyrt Daniel roo, Cur-jee yn jees shoh gys y derrey heu, yn derrey yeh foddey voish y jeh elley, as neem’s ad y eyshtey. ","51 Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them."

","52 So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light."
"53 Son t'ou er n'ockley magh briwnys foalsey, as er gheyrey yn ôney, as er n'eaysley yn kyndagh; son ooilley as dy vel yn Chiarn gra, Yn oney as ynrick cha jean oo y stroie.

"60 Er shen dyllee yn slane chaglym lesh coraa ard, as ren ad Jee y voylley, ta sauail adsyn ta treishteil aynsyn. ","60 With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them that trust in him."

Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day.

"2 As va Daniel ainjyssagh er y ree, as goit dy mie erskyn ooilley e chaarjyn. ","2 And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honoured above all his friends."
"3 Nish va jalloo ec ny Babylonianee enmysit Bel, as va baarit er dy chooilley laa daa howse jeig liauyr dy flooyr meein, as daeed keyrrey, as shey siyn feeyney. ","3 Now the Babylonians had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine."
"4 As hug y ree ooashley da, as hie eh stiagh gagh laa dy choyrt arrym da; agh dooashlee Daniel e Yee hene. As dooyrt y ree rish, Kys nagh vel uss gooashlaghey Bel?

"6 Eisht dooyrt y ree rish, Nee smooinaghtyn t'ou nagh vel Bel ny Yee bio? nagh vel oo fakin cre wheesh as t'eh gee as giu dy chooilley laa? ","6 Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?"

"13 As choont ad beg jeh: son fo'n voayrd v'ad er n'yannoo fosley follit, er hie ad stiagh dy kinjagh, as stroie ad ny reddyn shoh. ","13 And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things."

Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king's signet, and so departed."
"15 Nish ayns yn oie haink ny saggyrtyn, marish nyn mraane as nyn gloan, (myr bollagh ad), as ren ad gee as giu seose ooilley. ","15 Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all."

"17 As dooyrt y ree, Ghaniel, Vel ny sealyn slane? as dooyrt eshyn, Ta, O ree, t'ad slane. ","17 And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole."
"18 As cha leah as doshil eh'n dorrys, yeeagh y ree er y voayrd, as deie eh lesh coraa ard, S'mooar t'ou uss, O Bel, as mayrt's cha vel molteyrys erbee. ","18 And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all."
"19 Eisht ghear Daniel, as chum eh yn ree nagh darragh eh stiagh, as dooyrt eh, Jeeagh er y laare, as gow tastey vie jeh quoi ny kesmadyn-cass ad shoh. ","19 Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these."
"20 As dooyrt y ree, Hee'm kesmadyn-cass deiney, mraane, as paitchyn. As eisht va'n ree jymmoosagh. ","20 And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,"
"21 As goaill ny saggyrtyn marish nyn mraane as paitchyn, yeeagh ad da yn dorrys follit raad haink ad stiagh, dy stroie lheid ny reddyn as v'er y voayrd. ","21 And took the priests with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table."
"22 Shen-y-fa varr y ree ad, as livrey eh Bel gys pooar Ghaniel, quoi stroie eh-hene as e hiamble. ","22 Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel's power, who destroyed him and his temple."
"23 As 'syn ynnyd cheddin va Dragon mooar, da hug mooinjer Vabylon ooashley. ","23 And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped."
"24 As dooyrt y ree rish Daniel, Jean oo myrgeddin gra dy vel shoh dy phrash? Jeeagh, t'eh bio, t'eh gee as giu; cha vod oo gra nagh vel eh shoh ny Yee bio: er-y-fa shen cur ooashley da. ","24 And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him."
"25 Eisht dooyrt Daniel rish y ree, Verryms ooashley da'n Chiarn my Yee: son she eshyn y Jee bio. ","25 Then said Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God."
"26 Agh cur kied dou, O ree, as nee'm yn Dragon shoh y stroie fegooish cliwe ny lorg. Dooyrt y ree, Ta mish cur kied dhyt. ","26 But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give thee leave."
"27 Eisht ghow Daniel pick, as geirr, as geaysh, as vroie eh cooidjagh ad, as ren eh crammanyn y yannoo jeh'n chooid cheddin: shoh hug eh ayns beeal y Dragon, as lesh va'n Dragon er ny scoltey veih my cheilley: as dooyrt Daniel, Cur-my-ner, ad shoh ny jeeghyn ta shiuish dyn ooashlaghey. ","27 Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon's mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder: and Daniel said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship."
"28 Tra va mooinjer Vabylon er chlashtyn shen v'ad corree, as hug ad nyn goyrle dy-cheilley noi'n ree, gra, Ta'n ree er jeet dy ve ny Hew, as t'eh er stroie Bel, t'eh er varroo yn Dragon, as er choyrt ny saggyrtyn dy baase. ","28 When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain the dragon, and put the priests to death."
"29 Myr shen haink ad gys y ree, as dooyrt ad, Livrey hooin Daniel er-nonney nee mayd uss y stroie as dty hie. ","29 So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine house."
"30 Nish tra honnick y ree dy row ad chionney er dy creoi, v'eh eignit as livrey eh Daniel huc: ","30 Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them:"
31 As hilg ad eh ayns ooig ny lionyn: raad v'eh son shey laa. ,31 Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days.
"32 As ayns yn ooig va shiaght lionyn, as v'ad er choyrt daue dy chooilley laa daa chonvayrt, as daa cheyrrey: nagh row er ny choyrt daue tra shen, jerkal dy jinnagh ad gee Daniel. ","32 And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel."
"33 Nish va ayns Jewry phadeyr enmysit Habbacuc, v’er n’yannoo poddash, as er vrishee arran ayns meilley, as v'eh goll gys y vagher dy chur lesh eh gys ny beayneeyn. ","33 Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers."
"34 Agh dooyrt ainle y Chiarn rish Habbacuc, Immee, cur lhiat yn jinnair shen t'ayd gys Babylon gys Daniel, quoi t'ayns ooig ny lionyn. ","34 But the angel of the Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the lions' den."
"35 As dooyrt Habbacuc, Hiarn, cha vaik mish rieau Babylon; chamoo ta fys aym c'raad ta'n ooig. ","35 And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is."
"36 Eaisht ghow ainle y Chiarn eh er mullagh e vollag, as hrog eh seose eh liorish folt e chione, as liorish jeeanid e spyrryd hug eh sheese eh ayns Babylon harrish yn ooig. ","36 Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den."
"37 As deie Habbacuc, gra, Ghaniel, Ghaniel, gow yn jinnair ta Jee er choyrt hood. ","37 And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee."
"38 As dooyrt Daniel, T'ou uss er chooinaghtyn orrym, O Yee: chamoo t'ou er hreigeil adsyn ta shirrey er-dty-hon's as ta graihagh ort. ","38 And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee."
"39 Myr shen dirree Daniel, as ren eh gee: as hug ainle Chiarn Habbacuc ayns e ynnyd hene reesht er-y-chooyl. ","39 So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again immediately."
"40 Er y chiaghtoo laa hie'n ree dy ghobberan son Daniel: as tra haink eh gys yn ooig, yeeagh eh ayn, as cur-my-ner, va Daniel ny hoie. ","40 Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting."
"41 Eisht deie yn ree lesh coraa ard, gra, S’mooar t’ou uss, O Chiarn Jee Ghaniel, as cha vel unnane erbee ta corrym rhyts. ","41 Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee."
"42 As hayrn eh magh eh, as hilg eh adsyn va oyr e hoyrt-mow ayns yn ooig: as v'ad er nyn stroie ayns meekey kiongoyrt rish e eddin. ","42 And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face."
